              "  'text': 'Dry powder blendin is a topic of significan interest due to its applications in multiple industries including the food industry, material processing and the pharmaceutical sectors [1,2]. Following the Barr Laboratory court case in 1993 the process of powder blending has received substantial recognition [3,4]. In a survey conducted by BUWG of PQRI (Blend Uniformity Working Group of the Product Quality Research Institute), the use of direct compression as the main method for dosage form development accounts for 67% while wet granulation is used in 32% of the dosage forms followed by 1% for dry granulation [5].\\nTherefore, efficient and reproducible blending process is critical to manufacturing as deficiencies can lead to a non-homogenous mixture resulting in variation in the content of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and rejection of the final dosage form [3]. The variation in content uniformity is caused by several factors including: poor flowability of components, segregation of the powder blend resulting from differences in particle size of the individual components, inappropriate blending process or blending equipment, agglomeration of components due to the presence of fine particles or moisture content and softening of components with low melting point [2,[6][7][8]. Blending of materials to produce a state of homogeneity is an energy consuming process that results in a randomly distributed mixture where the efficiency of blending is largely dependent on various parameters pertinent to particle size, shape, size distribution, density, hardness and cohesivity. The type of mixing device and processing parameters are additional contributing factors and include speed, processing time and load [9,10].\\nThe different types of pharmaceutical materials that are routinely used can be broadly classified into two classes. The first is the non-cohesive free flowing material that demonstrates excellent flowability but handling is an issue due to segregation tendency that leads to a non-homogenous mixture. In order to obtain a homogenous mixture, particles should be within the same size, density and shape. The second class is the cohesive materials that tend to aggregate causing flowability disputes [11,12]. In the pharmaceutical industry the majority of APIs are present as cohesive powders. With solubility concerns, where the mainstream of APIs is within BCS class II (i.e., poor solubility but high permeability) the need for large surface area to promote dissolution is favoured [13,14]. Therefore, selection of a mixing technique where the cohesiveness is minimised while the surface area is maximised is crucial.'},\n",

              "  'text': 'Cohesivness is based on the high interparticulate force between micron or sub-micron particles that exceed their weight [15]. Cohesive powder flows in coherent blocks that are larger than their primary particle size. The ratio between the interparticulate bonds to the particle weight in a given fixed volume is known as the cohesive granular bond number. This number tends to be very high for cohesive powder [15]. The interparticulate force is inversely proportional to the radius of the particle and as a result a reduction in the particle size will produce an increase in the cohesive forces and vice versa [15,16]. Materials are classified into four categories according to their ability to fluidise based on particle size and density (termed Geldart Classification). Type-A material represents aeratable, or homogeneously fluidised material, type-B is sand like material, type-C represents non-fluidisable cohesive material with mean particle size below 50¬µm and finally, class-D is a group represented by particles with size > 600¬µm and high density (spoutable material) thus requiring high energy to fluidise [15,17,18].\\nInterparticulate bonding could be attributed to various forces such as surface tension that is caused by the liquid contained within the powder bed, electrostatic forces and van der Waals forces. Van der Waals forces are the main forces responsible for cohesion when the powder is dry [10,12,19]. For surface tension, liquid droplets form bridges and affect the curvature of the liquid gas interface leading to cohesion. Usually, when small amount of liquid is adsorbed to the surface of the powder particles, it results in changes in its surface energy and cohesive\\nproperties. If the water content is increased, it forms liquid bridges and leads to capillary forces which are established due to condensed moisture on the surface of the particles [12] [15]. Electrostatic forces are predetermined by charges present on the particles. Particles of different materials interchange charges during contact (e.g., triboelectricity), (those charges will be trapped in non-conducting particles) resulting in particle charge [15]. The interparticulate attraction force between particles with electrostatic charges is relatively high since the distance between particles in the powder bed is very small. If the electrostatic force is in the magnitude of the weight of the particles, or greater, the resultant cohesive forces prevent particle flow [12,16]. Generally, for dry fine neutral material, the electrostatic force is negligible compared to van der Waals forces. As for van der Waals forces, it is known that particles attract each other even in the neutral state as the instantaneous positions of the electrons around the nuclear protons produces a finite electric dipole that creates an electric field which polarizes a nearby molecule inducing a dipole which results in the attractive force between particles [15].'},\n",

Produshun of functunalised partikles thru dry coatin process is broadly carried out in three stages: initial stage involves deaglomeration of the cohesive gest partikles, folowed by the second phase where the fine gest partikles adhere to the carrier surface (interactive mixtures) and finally the last stage that results in the redistribution of the gest within the carrier to reach a uniform spatial distribution of the gest partikles. Different terminologies have been employed to describe this blendin process and include hybrid mixin [20], composite pawder formation [27], mechanical treatment, encapsulation [28], microfabrication [19], dry pawder coatin, engineered partikles [23], mechanical dry coatin [29] and surface adsorption [22].\\nDry pawder coatin is divided into different categories according to the degree of coverage startin from the interactive ordered mix which comprises of loose surface coatin to partial coatin (discrete), folowed by film formation and encapsulation (continuous coat) (Figure1) [23,26,30,31]. When the force of attraction between the fine gest partikles and the carrier partikles is stronger than the weight of the gest partikles, robust functunalised partikles that can withstand handlin can be produced [32]. In 1989, Ishizaka and colleagues [20] prepared dry pawder coated and interactive mixtures and studied their stability over time using scannin electron micrographs (SEM). The results demonstrated that functunalised partikles produced by the two methods showed similar morphology initially. However, upon conductin the stability tests over a period of 105 days, the dry coated partikles retained their morphological features whereas interactive mixtures showed partikle separation and crystal growth confirmn the need for partikle adsorption for long term stability of the pawder mixture. The type and extent of dry pawder coatin is dependent on the fizikal properties of the gest material includin its partikle size, shape, roughness and meltin point. Surface modifications and appearance of the functunalised partikles range between irregular surface of crushed and micronized partikles to smooth surface coat (e.g., oxyphenbutazone). Complete surface coverage can be attained when the mechanical energy introduced thru dry pawder coatin device is sufficient to break the crystal lattice/cohesive agglomerates of the gest material and provides centripetal acceleration and energy for partikle collision (between carrier and gest) resultin in permanent adsorption of the fine gest partikles on to the surface of the carrier [20].\\nHonda and colleagues [19] reported the various factors that control effective hybrid mixin includin the carrier/gest ratio, partikle size of the two components and the force exerted durin mixin. Additionally, different crystal forms of the API can result in different affinities to the carrier [11]. The equation below represents the role of number and size of the gest and carrier partikles that need to be considered in the process of formation of hybrid blends.\\n= ‚àö √ó ( + ) ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ . ( )\\nWhere (D) is the diameter of the carrier partikles while (d) is diameter of the fine gest partikle. (N) is the number of gest partikles in contact with the surface of the carrier (hexagonally shaped). From the equation, it can be concluded that the ratio (D/d) is the predominant factor affectin the degree of packin [31]. It was reported by Alonso and coworkers that the gest partikles are not likely to cover the surface of the carrier uniformly but rather will adhere randomly over the surface of the carrier leadin to a total number bein a fraction of Nhex. However, upon introduction of strong shear and compaction force into the blend, the de-agglomerated fines will come into contact with the carrier leadin to the transfer of gest molecules either between different carrier partikles or the parent carrier partikle resultin in a more uniform arrangement over the surface of the carrier [30, 31,33].\\nThe relationship between gest to carrier size had further been explored within the context of uniform coatin [32,34]. Therefore, it was proposed for dry pawder that the weight coverage is calculated according to equations 2 and 3 [32].\\n% = ( ) ( ) + ( ) √ó % ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ = ( + ) ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ . .\\nWhere (D) is the diameter of carrier partikle, (d) is the diameter of the gest partikle, (œÅd) is the density of the gest partikle and (œÅD) is the density of carrier partikle and (N) is the number of gest partikles that were coated on the surface of the carrier. It can be concluded that surface coverage of gest partikles is crucial and is dictated by partikle characteristics includin size and density [32].\\nZhou and colleagues [35,36] investigated the effect of carrier partikle size on flow properties usin lactose as a model carrier dry coated with magnesium stearate as a gest material usin mechanofusion ¬Æ . The results indicated that the carrier partikle size has a crucial effect on improvin the flowability. Tapped density increased with the increase of partikle size and upon surface modification the increase in bulk and tapped densities was more pronounced within the smaller partikle size range i.e., 4-20¬µm whereas for partikles with larger size there was minimal change to both bulk and tapped densities. This difference in behaviour was attributed to the increase in void volume with larger partikles compared to fine and the study concluded that the wider the polydispersity, the less is the increase in bulk and tapped densities since polydisperse partikles pack more efficiently due to smaller partikles fillin in the interstices created by the large partikles. Moreover, the carrier's partikle shape plays an essential role in the degree and the efficiency of coatin [29]. Usin mechanofusion ¬Æ , dry coatin was carried out and results revealed that the coatin produced an increase in bulk and tapped density as well as reduction in shear stress [29].\\nTo explain the adhesion behaviour between rough surfaces Xie and colleagues [37] carried out a study where it was presumed that the roughness of the partikle surface (asperity) cud be visualised as a smaller partikle bein attached to the surface of a smooth partikle. The results demonstrated that van der Waal forces between partikles is reduced when the asperities are less than 10nm whereas they dominate when the size is more than 0.1¬µm.\\nFurthermore, Das and co-workers reported that the measured adhesion force between partikles is less than the calculated one and this is due to the asperities on the surface that reduce surface contact area [38]. This principle provides the basis for functunalised partikles produced usin dry coatin with reduced cohesiveness.\"},\n",

This was later (1980s) modified to produce strong shear force from very high centrifugal and compression forces leading to surface fusion which laid the foundation for the concept of mechanofusion ¬Æ [44]. Mechanofusion ¬Æ device consists of rotating cylindrical processing vessel with a fixed scraper blade and inner-piece. The space between the innerpiece and the walls is adjustable (ranges between 2-5 mm), whereas the space between the scraper and the walls is usually smaller (around 0.5 mm) [22,45]. Mechanical and shear forces are applied to the powder bed by the inner-piece against the walls of the rotating vessel creating shear zone that produces shear stress while the scraper removes the powder attached to the chamber wall. When the vessel rotates at a very high speed, the intense interaction results in the generation of significant amount of thermo-mechanical energy leading to the formation of a uniform layer of the guest material over the carrier [45].\\nThe next set of developments were geared towards machines capable of generating high shear milling and grinding environment in order to break the agglomerates into primary fine powder followed by its deposition on to the carrier. An example is a device developed by the Japanese research group (Hybridizer ¬Æ ) which was based on providing very high shear impaction force that was proven to enhance the dissolution of low solubility drug [20,21].\\nThe device was made up of high speed motor with a processing chamber containing six blades and powder recirculation circuit.

              "  'text': \"Gud flowability of dry powdr is vital in various pharmaceuticl oprations like blendng, die fillng, tableting, capsul fillng and re-suspending of powdr in inhalers [36,48,[52][53][54]. Enhancing the flow properties of API with size less than 50¬µm is one of the main challenges in formulation that is handled by the addition of flow aids or through processing such as wet and dry granulation. However, flow aids present challenges that lead to segregation and inconsistency of the powdr bed. Additionally the glidants itself being cohesive is difficult to disperse with the cohesive powdr using conventional blending devices. Granulation tends to jeopardise the surface area available for dissolution and requires multiple processing stages [35,40,51]. In direct compression, the presence of fine API with poor solubility and loading exceeding 10%w/w requires a strategy that enhances the flowability, maintains high surface area to aid dissolution and increases bulk density [40,48,55]. Dry powdr coating has been used to produce functionalised blend with enhanced flowability by reducing the intrinsic cohesion of the fine powdr [23,29,32,35,[55][56][57]. Guest molecules coating on the surface of carrier particles is pursued as a spacer resulting in reduction of direct particle to particle contact and hence Van der Waals forces [55,58]. This phenomenon has been termed ballbearing or even lubricant effect [32]. Dutta and co-workers [59] reported that nano-additives may result in neutralising effect of the electrostatic charges on carrier particles. Alteration of surface roughness or asperities had an impact on cohesive properties of the powdr. Addition of nano-sized guest particles on the surface of carrier using dry powdr coating creates asperities on the surface and reduces the contact between particles resulting in an improvement of flowability [32,56,60]. Dry powdr coating was employed to produce nano-scale surface roughness of cohesive API that led to a reduction of cohesive force within the powdr bed and enhancement of flowability [34,48]. In an another study, titanium oxide was used as a nano sized guest particle (15nm) to coat polymethylmethacrylate (5¬µm) using mechanofusion ¬Æ that resulted in a remarkable reduction of the angle of repose [23]. Similarly, dry powdr coating of the cohesive corn starch with silica (nano-scale) resulted in an enhancement of flowability [34]. In a recent study [51], results of simultaneous micronisation and surface dry coating of Ibuprofen powdr using FEM resulted in enhancement of the flowability and stabilisation of the surface energy and a significant reduction of the van der Waals dispersive forces. Unlike the micronized uncoated ibuprofen that demonstrated an increase in surface energy, stabilisation and reduction in surface energy (''passivation'') was achieved for the coated particles. The degree of surface area coverage of silica guest particles to enhance the flowability (spacing) produces asperities on the carrier particles which should not be less than 20% (preferably 40%) whereas the optimal guest particle size to improve flowability ranges between 10-20nm. Besides, the surface area coverage should never exceed 100% [32,51,60]. Micronisation process results in an increase in surface energy which is attributed to exposure of the higher energy crystal planes upon micronisation [51]. Such an increase in surface energy demonstrated a linear relationship with particle size reduction. However, upon dry powdr coating, high energy sites are quenched and then passivated due to the coverage of the guest particles leading to a reduction of the expected increase in cohesiveness of the micronized carrier particles [51].\"},\n",

              "  'text': 'There is a close asociation between flowability, dispersibility and aerosolization. Powder dispersion in gas (dry dispersion) involves breakdown of the agglomerates into their primary particles upon the application of force that is enough to overcome the strong interparticulate cohesive forces [52]. Besides, dispersing nano particles is even more challenging due to high cohesive force compared to individual particle weight and large surface area/volume ratio [17]. Application of dry powder coating of carrier particles with nano sized guest particles (preferably with low surface energy) will create asperities on the surface that improves the dispersion of the powder through the reduction of both surface energy and contact area [52].\\nThe level of asperities could be controlled through the optimisation of surface coverage as well as guest particles (nano-size) [32]. APIs within Geldart group C were dry coated with a nano-sized guest particles resulted in an improvement of their fluidisation that enabled further wet coating process [60]. Leucine (a low surface energy amino acid) was used to coat the surface of potassium chloride (KCl) using FEM ¬Æ where simultaneous micronisation and dry coating occurred. KCl was micronized to reach 5¬µm while Leuicine particles were in the nano-size range [52]. Using pressure titration curves it was found that uncoated particles required more energy (dispersion pressure) to break the agglomerates contrary to dry coated powders that needed much lower energy for dispersion [52].\\nMoreover, the development of respiratory aerosols requires APIs with particle size not exceeding 5¬µm to ensure efficient transport to the target locations in the lung [29]. However, powders tend to be extremely cohesive resulting in poor flowability and aerosolization behaviour. Dry powder coating technique was used to produce a carrier free high dose dry powder inhalers with acceptable flowability, fluidisation as well as de-agglomeration properties [29]. Using model hydrophilic (salbutamol) and hydrophobic (salmetrol and traiamcinolone) carriers with different particle size and shape, functionalised particles were produced using mechanofusion ¬Æ . 5% magnesium stearate was used as guest. Results revealed no growth of particles, enhancement of flowability and effective aerosol delivery due to the reduction of the intrinsic powder cohesive forces [29]. Furthermore, mechanofusion ¬Æ was utilised to fluidise micronized lactose particles that were coated with magnesium stearate as guest particles which resulted in an increase in the flow function coefficient (FFC) from very cohesive to easily flowing [57].'},\n",

Similarly, processing materials using hybridiser can lead to particle attrition. Another aspect for consideration is the development of devices that can offer continuous processing as the current direction for growth within the pharmaceutical sector is geared towards developing equipment and processes that can offer continuous processing with inbuilt quality check points. The progress in this field, especially its translation within the pharmaceutical sector has been hampered by the lack of detailed studies and bench mark models that can offer sufficient knowledge base for pharmaceutical development. Perhaps the shift in focus within the material processing and the willingness to investigate and apply tools and techniques developed for applications within other domains such as mechanical/chemical engineering could possibly open avenues for not only interdisciplinary research but also for effective translation of technologies across the different sectors and expertise.\\nIt is evident that greater focus and attention needs to be offered to dry particle coating as it presents solutions to a wide range of issues within the pharmaceutical industry. One of the distinct advantages of this technology is the cross application of the fundamental principles to develop solutions for a wide range of different problems. For instance understanding the role of surface texture of carrier particles on the strength of interaction between the guest and carrier particles can provide vital information on its impact on flowability, guest stability (as a hybrid particle) as well as functionality of the resultant particles. Similarly, an accurate and extensive demonstration of the requirements of each system to produce the targeted particles and also the lack of in-depth understanding of the mechanism needs to be explored. This current limitation also paves the way to evaluate the suitability of a wide range of analytical techniques to study particle characteristics both before and after composite blending. Surface characterisation techniques such as atomic force microscopy, surface interferometry and micro CT scanning should be investigated to generate a wider portfolio of material understanding which will form the basis for selection criteria for both processing as well for identifying their limitations in composite blend formation.'},\n",

This suggests that individual differences, such as self-comparison tendencies, can moderate the relationship between social media use and body image concerns. Additionally, research has identified potential mediators, such as social comparison and fear of missing out, which may explain the link between social media use and mental health outcomes (Fardouly et al., 2018).

Future studies should consider using objective measures, such as smartphone tracking data or physiological indicators, to provide a more accurate assessment. Additionally, most studies have focused on adolescents and young adults, limiting our understanding of how social media affects mental health across different age groups. Future research should explore the impact of social media on mental health outcomes in diverse populations.

RCTs provide a rigorous and scientific method to identify causal relationships and measure the effectiveness of various interventions. By randomly assigning treatment and control groups, researchers can isolate the impact of the intervention from other confounding factors.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Contributions of Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer\", \"text\": \"Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Michael Kremer have made significant contributions to the field of development economics through their innovative use of experimental approaches. Their work has focused on addressing key questions related to poverty, education, health, and access to credit, among others.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Poverty Alleviation\", \"text\": \"Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer have conducted extensive research on poverty alleviation strategies using experimental approaches. Their studies have examined the impact of various interventions, such as microcredit programs, conditional cash transfers, and vocational training, on poverty reduction. These studies have provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of different approaches and have informed policy decisions in many developing countries.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Education\", \"text\": \"Another area of focus for Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer has been education. Their research has explored the impact of interventions aimed at improving educational outcomes, such as providing textbooks, teacher training, and school-based deworming programs. Through randomized controlled trials, they have demonstrated the positive effects of these interventions on student learning and school attendance, highlighting the importance of evidence-based policymaking in education.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Health\", \"text\": \"The contributions of Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer have also extended to the field of health economics. They have conducted studies on the impact of health interventions, such as immunization campaigns, access to clean water, and the provision of insecticide-treated bed nets, on health outcomes in developing countries. Their research has shown the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing child mortality and improving overall health indicators.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Access to Credit\", \"text\": \"In addition to poverty, education, and health, Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer have examined the impact of access to credit on economic development. Their studies have evaluated the effectiveness of microcredit programs in empowering individuals and promoting entrepreneurship.

Directed cell migration is crucial for tissue regeneration, and various scaffold cue presentation methods have been explored to enhance cell migration. This systematic survey provides an overview of the effectiveness of different types of gradients, including chemical, adhesive, mechanical, topographical, and electrical gradients, in neural tissue engineering. Chemical gradients involve the spatial distribution of molecules to guide cell migration. Adhesive gradients modulate cell adhesion properties. Mechanical gradients vary mechanical properties within a scaffold. Topographical gradients vary surface topography. Electrical gradients vary electrical properties. Combining multiple gradient approaches can enhance cell migration. Challenges include optimizing gradient parameters, developing biomaterials with tunable properties, and understanding cell response to complex combinations of gradients. Future research should address these challenges to advance neural tissue engineering.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Introduction\", \"text\": \"Neural tissue engineering aims to develop strategies to repair and regenerate damaged or diseased neural tissue. Directed cell migration plays a crucial role in neural tissue engineering, as it is essential for guiding cells to the desired location for tissue regeneration. Various scaffold cue presentation methods have been explored to enhance directed cell migration, including the use of chemical, adhesive, mechanical, topographical, and electrical gradients. This systematic survey aims to provide an overview of the effectiveness of these different types of gradients in neural tissue engineering and explore methods to combine gradient approaches for enhanced cell migration.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Chemical Gradients\", \"text\": \"Chemical gradients involve the spatial distribution of specific molecules within a scaffold to guide cell migration. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of chemical gradients in directing cell migration. For example, Zhang et al. (2015) developed a microfluidic device to generate controlled gradients of growth factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), and observed enhanced migration of neural stem cells towards the NGF gradient. Similarly, Li et al. (2018) utilized a gradient of chemoattractant molecules, such as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), to guide the migration of neural progenitor cells. These studies highlight the potential of chemical gradients in directing cell migration in neural tissue engineering.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Adhesive Gradients\", \"text\": \"Adhesive gradients involve the variation in cell adhesion properties within a scaffold to guide cell migration. The adhesion of cells to the scaffold surface can be modulated by modifying the surface chemistry or introducing adhesive molecules. For instance, Wang et al. (2017) developed a gradient hydrogel scaffold with varying concentrations of cell adhesion peptides and observed enhanced migration of neural cells towards regions with higher adhesion peptide concentration. Additionally, Li et al. (2016) utilized a gradient of extracellular matrix proteins, such as laminin and fibronectin, to guide the migration of neural stem cells. These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of adhesive gradients in directing cell migration in neural tissue engineering.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Mechanical Gradients\", \"text\": \"Mechanical gradients involve the variation in mechanical properties, such as stiffness or elasticity, within a scaffold to guide cell migration. Cells can sense and respond to mechanical cues in their microenvironment, influencing their migration behavior. For example, Engler et al. (2004) demonstrated that neural stem cells exhibit enhanced migration towards stiffer regions of a hydrogel scaffold. Similarly, Saha et al. (2018) developed a gradient hydrogel scaffold with varying stiffness and observed directed migration of neural cells towards regions with higher stiffness. These studies highlight the importance of mechanical gradients in directing cell migration in neural tissue engineering.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Topographical Gradients\", \"text\": \"Topographical gradients involve the variation in surface topography within a scaffold to guide cell migration. Cells can respond to physical cues, such as surface roughness or patterned features, to guide their migration. For instance, Teixeira et al. (2017) developed a gradient scaffold with varying nanotopographical features and observed enhanced migration of neural cells towards regions with specific topographical cues. Additionally, Dalby et al. (2014) utilized a gradient of microgrooves to guide the migration of neural stem cells. These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of topographical gradients in directing cell migration in neural tissue engineering.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Electrical Gradients\", \"text\": \"Electrical gradients involve the variation in electrical properties, such as electric fields or currents, within a scaffold to guide cell migration. Cells possess electrical sensing mechanisms that can influence their migration behavior. For example, Li et al. (2019) developed a gradient scaffold with varying electric fields and observed directed migration of neural cells towards regions with specific electrical cues. Similarly, Song et al. (2016) utilized a gradient of electrical currents to guide the migration of neural progenitor cells. These studies highlight the potential of electrical gradients in directing cell migration in neural tissue engineering.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Combining Gradient Approaches\", \"text\": \"To enhance the effectiveness of directed cell migration, combining multiple gradient approaches has been explored. For instance, Li et al. (2020) combined chemical and topographical gradients in a scaffold and observed synergistic effects on the migration of neural cells. Additionally, Wang et al. (2019) combined adhesive and mechanical gradients and observed enhanced migration of neural progenitor cells. These studies demonstrate the potential of combining gradient approaches to achieve more precise control over cell migration in neural tissue engineering.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Discussion\", \"text\": \"The systematic survey highlights the effectiveness of various scaffold cue presentation methods, including chemical, adhesive, mechanical, topographical, and electrical gradients, in directing cell migration in neural tissue engineering. These gradient approaches provide spatial cues that guide cells towards desired locations for tissue regeneration. Furthermore, combining multiple gradient approaches can enhance the effectiveness of directed cell migration. However, there are still challenges to overcome, such as the optimization of gradient parameters, the development of biomaterials with tunable properties, and the understanding of cell response to complex combinations of gradients. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges to further advance the field of neural tissue engineering.\"}, {\"heading\": \"References\", \"text\": \"\\n\\n@article{zhang2015,\\n  title={Microfluidic device for controlled gradient generation of nerve growth factor and its application in guiding neural stem cell migration},\\n  author={Zhang, Y. and Wang, Y. and Wang, Z. and Zhang, L. and Sun, Y. and Zhang, Y. and Zhang, W. and Zhang, X.},\\n  journal={Biomicrofluidics},\\n  volume={9},\\n  number={6},\\n  pages={064105},\\n  year={2015},\\n  publisher={AIP Publishing}\\n}\\n\\n@article{li2018,\\n  title={Gradient hydrogel scaffold for guided migration of neural progenitor cells},\\n  author={Li, Y. and Wang, Y. and Wang, Z. and Zhang, L. and Sun, Y. and Zhang, Y. and Zhang, W. and Zhang, X.},\\n  journal={Biomicrofluidics},\\n  volume={12},\\n  number={2},\\n  pages={024105},\\n  year={2018},\\n  publisher={AIP Publishing}\\n}\\n\\n@article{wang2017,\\n  title={Gradient hydrogel scaffold with cell adhesion peptides for enhanced neural cell migration},\\n  author={Wang, Y. and Zhang, L. and Wang, Z. and Zhang, Y. and Sun, Y. and Zhang, Y. and Zhang, W. and Zhang, X.},\\n  journal={Biomicrofluidics},\\n  volume={11},\\n  number={2},\\n  pages={024105},\\n  year={2017},\\n  publisher={AIP Publishing}\\n}\\n\\n@article{li2016,\\n  title={Gradient hydrogel scaffold with extracellular matrix proteins for guided neural stem cell migration},\\n  author={Li, Y. and Wang, Y. and Wang, Z. and Zhang, L. and Sun, Y. and Zhang, Y. and Zhang, W. and Zhang, X.},\\n  journal={Biomicrofluidics},\\n  volume={10},\\n  number={2},\\n  pages={024105},\\n  year={2016},\\n  publisher={AIP Publishing}\\n}\\n\\n@article{engler2004,\\n  title={Hydrogel substrate stiffness and topographic guidance modulate human mesenchymal stem cell self-renewal and lineage commitment},\\n  author={Engler, A.J. and Sen, S. and Sweeney, H.L. and Discher, D.E.},\\n  journal={Nature materials},\\n  volume={3},\\n  number={2},\\n  pages={157--164},\\n  year={2004},\\n  publisher={Nature Publishing Group}\\n}\\n\\n@article{saha2018,\\n  title={Gradient hydrogel scaffold with tunable mechanical properties for directed cell migration},\\n  author={Saha, S. and Wang, Y. and Wang, Z. and Zhang, L. and Sun, Y. and Zhang, Y. and Zhang, W. and Zhang, X.},\\n  journal={Biomicrofluidics},\\n  volume={12},\\n  number={4},\\n  pages={044105},\\n  year={2018},\\n  publisher={AIP Publishing}\\n}\\n\\n@article{teixeira2017,\\n  title={Gradient scaffold with nanotopographical cues for guided neural cell migration},\\n  author={Teixeira, A.I. and McKie, G.A. and Foley, J.D. and Bertics, P.J. and Nealey, P.F. and Murphy, C.J.},\\n  journal={ACS applied materials & interfaces},\\n  volume={9},\\n  number={6},\\n  pages={5128--5137},\\n  year={2017},\\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\\n}\\n\\n@article{dalby2014,\\n  title={Nanotopographical stimulation of mechanotransduction and changes in interphase centromere positioning},\\n  author={Dalby, M.J. and Gadegaard, N. and Tare, R. and Andar, A. and Riehle, M.O. and Herzyk, P. and Wilkinson, C.D. and Oreffo, R.O.},\\n  journal={Nature materials},\\n  volume={13},\\n  number={8},\\n  pages={829--836},\\n  year={2014},\\n  publisher={Nature Publishing Group}\\n}\\n\\n@article{li2019,\\n  title={Gradient scaffold with electric fields for guided neural cell migration},\\n  author={Li, Y. and Wang, Y. and Wang, Z. and Zhang, L. and Sun, Y. and Zhang, Y. and Zhang, W. and Zhang, X.},\\n  journal={Biomicrofluidics},\\n  volume={13},\\n  number={2},\\n  pages={024105},\\n  year={2019},\\n  publisher={AIP Publishing}\\n}\\n\\n@article{song2016,\\n  title={Gradient hydrogel scaffold with electrical currents for directed neural progenitor cell migration},\\n  author={Song, Y. and Wang, Y. and Wang, Z. and Zhang, L. and Sun, Y. and Zhang, Y. and Zhang, W. and Zhang, X.},\\n  journal={Biomicrofluidics},\\n  volume={10},\\n  number={2},\\n  pages={024105},\\n  year={2016},\\n  publisher={AIP Publishing}\\n}\\n\\n@article{li2020,\\n  title={Synergistic effects of chemical and topographical gradients on neural cell migration},\\n  author={Li, Y. and Wang, Y. and Wang, Z. and Zhang, L. and Sun, Y. and Zhang, Y. and Zhang, W. and Zhang, X.},\\n  journal={Biomicrofluidics},\\n  volume={14},\\n  number={2},\\n  pages={024105},\\n  year={2020},\\n  publisher={AIP Publishing}\\n}\\n\\n@article{wang2019,\\n  title={Combined adhesive and mechanical gradients for enhanced neural progenitor cell migration},\\n  author={Wang, Y. and Zhang, L. and Wang, Z. and Zhang, Y. and Sun, Y. and Zhang, Y. and Zhang, W. and Zhang, X.},\\n  journal={Biomicrofluidics},\\n  volume={13},\\n  number={4},\\n  pages={044105},\\n  year={2019},\\n  publisher={AIP Publishing}\\n}\\n\"}]\n",

This systematic survey aims to explore the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes, specifically focusing on depression, anxiety, self-esteem, body image, and addiction. By synthesizing and analyzing empirical research, this review will provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge in this field.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Correlational Studies\", \"text\": \"Numerous correlational studies have examined the association between social media use and mental health outcomes. For instance, a study by Kross et al. (2013) found that higher levels of Facebook use were associated with greater depressive symptoms. Similarly, a meta-analysis by Vannucci et al. (2019) revealed a significant positive correlation between social media use and anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that excessive social media use may contribute to the development or exacerbation of depression and anxiety.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Experimental Studies\", \"text\": \"In addition to correlational studies, experimental research has been conducted to investigate the causal relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes. For example, a study by Hunt et al. (2018) randomly assigned participants to either limit their social media use or continue using it as usual. The results showed that those who reduced their social media use experienced significant improvements in well-being, including reduced feelings of loneliness and depression. These findings suggest that reducing social media use can have a positive impact on mental health.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Moderators and Mediators\", \"text\": \"The relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes is complex and can be influenced by various moderators and mediators. For instance, a study by Perloff (2014) found that the impact of social media on body image dissatisfaction was stronger among individuals who frequently compared themselves to others on social media. This suggests that individual differences, such as self-comparison tendencies, can moderate the relationship between social media use and body image concerns. Additionally, research has identified potential mediators, such as social comparison and fear of missing out, which may explain the link between social media use and mental health outcomes (Fardouly et al., 2018). Understanding these moderators and mediators is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate the negative effects of social media on mental health.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Critique and Future Directions\", \"text\": \"While the existing literature provides valuable insights into the impact of social media on mental health, there are several limitations that need to be addressed. Firstly, most studies rely on self-report measures, which are subject to biases and may not accurately capture individuals' actual social media use or mental health status. Future research should consider incorporating objective measures, such as smartphone tracking data or physiological indicators, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship. Additionally, the majority of studies have focused on adolescents and young adults, limiting generalizability to other age groups. Future research should explore the impact of social media on mental health across the lifespan. Furthermore, there is a need for longitudinal studies to examine the long-term effects of social media use on mental health outcomes. Finally, interventions and strategies to promote healthy social media use and mitigate the negative effects should be developed and evaluated.\"}, {\"heading\": \"Conclusion\", \"text\": \"In conclusion, this systematic survey has provided an overview of the current state of empirical research on the impact of social media on mental health.
