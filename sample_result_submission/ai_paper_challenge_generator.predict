For instance, the intensity of social media use, such as the amount of time spent on platforms or the frequency of checking notifications, may moderate the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes. Additionally, factors such as age, gender, and personality traits may also play a role in determining the impact of social media on mental health.

Firstly, most studies rely on self-report measures, which are subject to biases and may not accurately capture individuals' actual social media use or mental health status. Secondly, the majority of research has focused on adolescents and young adults, limiting generalizability to other age groups. Additionally, the field would benefit from more longitudinal studies to examine the long-term effects of social media use on mental health outcomes.
