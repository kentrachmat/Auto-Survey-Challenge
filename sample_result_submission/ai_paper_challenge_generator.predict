This suggests that individual differences, such as self-comparison tendencies, can moderate the relationship between social media use and body image concerns. Additionally, research has identified potential mediators, such as social comparison and fear of missing out, which may explain the link between social media use and mental health outcomes (Fardouly et al., 2018).
