[{"heading": "Title", "text": "Inclusive Science Education in Indonesia: A Comprehensive Overview from Definition to Curriculum"}, {"heading": "Abstract", "text": "The study aims to investigate the teaching, curriculum, and methods used by teachers in the science learning process for students with special needs in Indonesia. The research method used is qualitative, and the subjects are students with visual, hearing, intellectual, and physical impairments at a special school in Kuningan, Indonesia. The findings reveal that most teachers use the government-provided curriculum from teacher books and employ the lecture and question-and-answer method in science learning. However, this approach results in low student achievement as students with special needs require concrete media and methods that cater to their needs."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Special education is a type of education that caters to children with special needs caused by internal or external factors. In Indonesia, the special education system has shifted from a medical perspective to a social perspective, where educators view children in terms of their optimized potential. The government provides opportunities for all children to receive education, including those with special needs. Science education is an important unit that involves various elements to obtain information and achieve a change that is closely related to the environment of human life. Teachers at special schools teach natural science learning based on the curriculum provided by the government, but they should also tailor the learning process plan to the conditions and needs of students at school. However, there is a lack of research on education and the science learning process for students with special needs in special schools. The aim of this study is to identify and inform the teaching, curriculum, and methods used in the science learning process for children with special needs in special schools in Indonesia."}, {"heading": "Definition Of Children With Special Needs In Indonesia", "text": "The paper discusses children with special needs who face obstacles and problems in their learning process due to internal and external factors. These children are categorized into permanent and temporary special needs. The permanent special needs include children with visual impairments, hearing impairments, and intellectual disabilities. Children with visual impairments are divided into two categories, low vision and blind. They require special educational services to aid their education and daily life. Children with hearing impairments lose part or all of their hearing power, which makes verbal communication difficult. Children with intellectual disabilities have below-average intelligence and face problems in adaptive behavior, making it difficult for them to complete tasks in everyday life. The paper highlights the need for special educational services to aid these children in their learning process and daily life."}, {"heading": "D. Children With Physical / Mobility Impairments (Tunadaksa)", "text": "The text discusses different types of children with special needs. Children with limb or physical impairments have permanent disabilities or neurological disorders. Children with emotional and behavioral disorders exhibit deviant behavior due to disruption of emotional and social development. Children with specific learning disorders have problems in the learning process caused by psychological, central nervous system dysfunction, and/or neurological disorders. Autistic children experience disturbances in interaction, communication, and social behavior. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have trouble concentrating and have hyperactive behaviors. On the other hand, children with temporary special needs experience learning and developmental ties due to environmental situations and conditions."}, {"heading": "Special Education System In Indonesia", "text": "The special education system in Indonesia has gone through three stages: segregation, integration, and inclusive education. Segregation involves separating children with special needs from the general education system, which is done through special education units or Special Schools (SLB) based on the type of disability. Integration, on the other hand, involves moving a student to an environment that is not too separate, such as a special unit or class within a regular school. Inclusive education is an approach that aims to remove barriers that hinder every student from fully participating in education. It is a practical change that benefits not only children with special needs but all children, parents, teachers, school administrators, and society as a whole. Inclusive education allows children with different backgrounds and abilities to succeed in learning. The opportunities for interaction with school members in general are much greater in inclusive education than in segregated education."}, {"heading": "Science Education", "text": "Science education is a crucial unit that involves various elements to obtain information and achieve a change related to human life's environment. Science is a body of knowledge that explains what, why, and how a phenomenon occurs. There are four main domains of science at the primary and secondary education levels, namely physics, biology, chemistry, and earth and space sciences. Science is a scientific discipline consisting of physical sciences and life sciences. Physical sciences include astronomy, chemistry, geology, mineralogy, meteorology, and physics, while life science includes biology. The scope of science is limited to things that can be understood by the senses such as taste, sight, and hearing."}, {"heading": "Demographics Of Students With Special Needs In Kuningan Indonesia", "text": "The study focused on 50 students with special needs at a Special School in Kuningan, Indonesia. The data was collected through interviews, observations, and documentation supported by portopilio. The study found that 10% of the students had visual impairment, 12% had hearing impairment, 70% had intellectual disabilities, and 8% had physical or muscular impairment. Figure 1 shows the percentage of each type of special need among the students."}, {"heading": "Science Learning Curriculum For Students With Special Needs", "text": "The Special School in Kuningan follows the 2013 national curriculum for science education, with integrated subjects in each chapter. The curriculum for students with disabilities is similar to that of regular schools, with differences in timing and level of material. Some teachers teach students with different types of barriers in one class, using a different book. However, it is recommended that teachers create their own curriculum tailored to the needs of each child while still following the national curriculum. Each book in the curriculum consists of one theme and four chapters, with each chapter containing six lessons. The analysis of the content of the science education curriculum for students with visual, hearing, and physical impairments is not significantly different from that of regular students. The only difference is in the timing and level of material taught."}, {"heading": "Learning Methods Used For Students With Special Needs", "text": "The learning method is an important factor in the learning process. In a special school in Indonesia, most teachers use the lecture and question and answer method in science learning, resulting in low learning outcomes for most students. Inquiry learning methods are rarely used, as teachers assume that students with special needs cannot learn complex science. However, using concrete learning media and adapting to children's needs can make it easier for them to understand science material."}, {"heading": "Summary", "text": "The paper discusses the challenges faced by students with special needs in their academic and developmental processes. These students require special education and services to aid their learning process. However, most teachers in special schools use a government-issued teacher's book to teach science, which may not be tailored to the needs of the students. The paper suggests that teachers should create a curriculum that is customized to the needs of the students while still adhering to the national curriculum. Additionally, the science learning method used by the teacher should be adapted to the material and the needs of the students with special needs. Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of personalized education for students with special needs to ensure their academic success."}, {"heading": "Conflict Of Interest", "text": "In this statement, the authors claim that their research was carried out without any financial or commercial ties that could be seen as a possible conflict of interest.
