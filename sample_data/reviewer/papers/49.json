[{"heading": "Title", "text": "\"Assessing Progress and Challenges in Medication Use in Developing and Transitional Countries: A 20-Year Review\""}, {"heading": "Abstract", "text": "The paper aims to evaluate the progress made in enhancing the use of medicines in developing and transitional countries. The assessment will be based on a review of empirical evidence from 1990 to 2009. The focus will be on the patterns of primary care medicine use and the effects of interventions. The study will provide insights into the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving the use of medicines in these countries. The findings will be useful in identifying areas that require further attention and investment to enhance the use of medicines. The study will also contribute to the development of policies and strategies that can improve access to medicines and enhance their appropriate use in developing and transitional countries."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The inappropriate and inefficient use of medicines is a widespread problem, particularly in developing and transitional countries where routine monitoring is often lacking. This limits initiatives to improve medicines use in resource-poor settings. WHO has recognized this problem for a long time, estimating that more than half of all medicines are prescribed inappropriately and that half of prescribed medicines are taken improperly by patients. To address this issue, the International Network of the Rational Use of Drugs (INRUD) developed a method and indicators to measure medicines use in primary care facilities in resource-poor settings. WHO supported the creation of a database of all studies of primary care medicines use in developing and transitional countries reporting on any of a defined set of medicines use indicators. The objective of the current study was to undertake a more in-depth analysis of studies over a longer period of time from the updated WHO Medicines Use Database for 1990-2009 on patterns of medicines use and effects of interventions to improve medicines use in developing and transitional countries."}, {"heading": "Details Of The Creation Of The Who Medicines Use", "text": "The text describes a study that was conducted to identify and analyze quantitative medicines use data in developing or transitional countries from 1990-2009. The study used 19 WHO/INRUD indicators or 20 other standard measures to identify eligible studies that reported data from a primary care setting. The data was extracted from reports and articles and entered into a Microsoft Access TM database. The study was conducted systematically and the results were presented in a previous publication by WHO in 2009. The study excluded countries located in North America or Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. The purpose of the study was to provide a comprehensive understanding of medicine use in developing or transitional countries and to identify areas for improvement in healthcare delivery."}, {"heading": "Search Strategy", "text": "The paper describes the process of identifying studies for a research project on drug use in developing countries. The studies were found through searches in various databases and archives, as well as hand-searched journals. The search terms included various drug-related topics and specific illnesses such as malaria and acute respiratory infections. Additionally, studies presented at two international conferences were reviewed and included if a full report was available. The first two authors read all identified studies and agreed on their eligibility for entry into the database. Any disagreements were discussed and resolved before inclusion. The INRUD bibliography, which contained over 8,000 references, was a primary source of studies. The paper emphasizes the importance of a thorough and systematic search process to ensure the quality and relevance of the studies included in the research project."}, {"heading": "Data Entry", "text": "The paper describes the process of extracting data for a database on medicine use practices in various settings, sectors, prescriber types, and years of data collection. Each record in the database describes medicine use indicators for a specific study group at a particular point in time and provider in a specific setting. Interventions were classified based on the component that best captured the nature of the intervention strategy evaluated, with hierarchical rules for interventions involving a mix of components. The data were entered and checked before being exported for analysis. Frequency distributions of key variables were created to assess data entry accuracy prior to analysis."}, {"heading": "Analysis", "text": "The paper discusses the analysis of data from non-intervention studies and baseline data from intervention studies, as well as control group data from post-only intervention studies and repeated measures from national surveys reported with no discrete intervention. The article presents descriptive data on six commonly reported WHO/INRUD prescribing indicators, which were chosen because their measurement is standardized and the number of studies reporting these indicators in surveys covering all age groups was much larger than studies reporting other indicators. Analyses of intervention impacts used data from studies meeting commonly accepted criteria for valid study designs. The paper also discusses the calculation of the effect size of interventions with strong study designs for each medicines use outcome measure and the estimation of the overall effectiveness of different intervention types. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding certain categories of data from descriptive analyses, but they did not substantially change the results, so all data are included in the results presented."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The paper reports on a study that identified 900 studies with 1033 study groups reporting data on primary care practice in 104 countries. The majority of studies reported practices in the public sector, while 24% were in the private-for-profit sector, 2% in the private-not-for-profit sector, and the rest in households or unknown facility types. The study groups included only those involving three or more health facilities and/or 600 or more patient encounters. A total of 325 study groups included only children under 5 years, while the remainder included individuals over 5 years or all ages. While all studies reported ambulatory primary health care practices, 46% were conducted in PHC settings, 21% in a mix of hospitals and PHC settings, 13% in hospitals only, 15% in pharmacies, 2% in non-licensed shops, and 3% in households. Prescribers were doctors in 35% of studies, nurses or paramedics in 52%, community health workers in 6%, pharmacy personnel in 4%, and lay providers in 3% of studies."}, {"heading": "Patterns Of Medicine Use", "text": "The paper discusses the use of medicines in the public and private sectors from 1990 to 2009, based on six INRUD/WHO prescribing indicators. The median number of medicines prescribed per patient has increased from 2.1 to 2.8, and the percentage of patients receiving antibiotics has increased from 42% to 51%. Only 50% of treatment followed STGs at the end of the study period. Table 1 shows that prescribing practices are generally similar across geographic regions, with some exceptions. Medicine use in the public sector tends to be closer to recommended practices than in the private-for-profit sector. Upper-middle-income countries tend to prescribe fewer EML medicines, fewer injections, and less frequently by generic name. Nurses and paramedics tend to prescribe more EML medicines and more frequently by generic name than doctors. The paper highlights the need for improved prescribing practices and adherence to STGs."}, {"heading": "Effects Of Interventions", "text": "The paper reports on 405 studies that aimed to improve medicine use, but only 27% of these interventions were evaluated using adequate study designs. The median GES (generic effect size) was 19% and the median MES (modified effect size) was 7%. Most interventions involved a combination of educational and managerial components, with economic interventions being the exception. Educational interventions mostly included printed materials, while supervisory interventions included some form of education for providers or consumers. Community case management interventions involved community members being trained and supervised to deliver basic primary care. Essential drug programs involved provider education and supervision with a controlled drug supply. Provider group process strategies involved providers in a quality improvement process. The most effective interventions were multicomponent interventions that incorporated provider and consumer education with supervision or those involving provider and community education, supervision, and a controlled drug supply. Single component interventions or poorly focused interventions tended to have a smaller or no positive impact."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The author expresses gratitude towards Amy Johnson and Sarah Lewis for their assistance in analyzing data from 1990 to 2006.

The project was financed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In conclusion, the study highlights the importance of improving the use of medicines in developing and transitional countries. The empirical evidence reviewed from 1990 to 2009 shows that interventions aimed at enhancing the use of primary care medicines have been effective in some areas. However, there is still a long way to go in terms of improving access to medicines and ensuring their appropriate use. The findings suggest that further investment and attention are needed to address the gaps in medicine use in these countries. Policymakers and stakeholders can use the insights provided by this study to develop effective policies and strategies that can enhance the use of medicines in developing and transitional countries. It is crucial to prioritize this issue to ensure that people in these countries have access to the medicines they need to improve their health and well-being."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{ali2005,\n  title={},\n  author={Asrar Ali et al.},\n  year={2005},\n}\n\n@article{francke2008,\n  title={},\n  author={A L Francke et al.},\n  year={2008},\n}\n\n@article{gallagher2007,\n  title={},\n  author={P Gallagher et al.},\n  year={2007},\n}\n\n@article{garfield2009,\n  title={},\n  author={S Garfield et al.},\n  year={2009},\n}\n\n@article{grol2003,\n  title={},\n  author={R Grol and J Grimshaw},\n  year={2003},\n}\n\n@article{holloway2011,\n  title={},\n  author={K A Holloway},\n  year={2011},\n}\n\n@article{jamtvedt2006,\n  title={},\n  author={G Jamtvedt et al.},\n  year={2006},\n}\n\n@article{massele1994,\n  title={},\n  author={A Y Massele and G M Mwaluko},\n  year={1994},\n}\n\n@article{park2005,\n  title={},\n  author={S Park et al.},\n  year={2005},\n}\n\n@article{rowe2005,\n  title={},\n  author={A K Rowe et al.},\n  year={2005},\n}\n\n@article{siddiqi2005,\n  title={},\n  author={K Siddiqi et al.},\n  year={2005},\n}\n\n@article{sketris2009,\n  title={},\n  author={I S Sketris et al.},\n  year={2009},\n}\n\n@article{trap2002a,\n  title={},\n  author={B Trap and E H Hansen},\n  year={2002},\n}\n\n@article{trap2002b,\n  title={},\n  author={B Trap et al.},\n  year={2002},\n}\n\n@article{wensing1998,\n  title={},\n  author={M Wensing et al.},\n  year={1998},\n}"}]
