This has led to an urgent need to address the detrimental environmental impact that results from a global economic system fueled by continuous (over)consumption. To create the needed transformations, it is imperative to change the way business is done [2]. Sustainability initiatives led by the private sector have mainly focused on upstream approaches (e.g., eco-efficiency) and have contributed to curbing the negative impacts of production and consumption to some extent, but often lead to rebound effects in which increased efficiency results in more consumption [3]. This creates a vicious cycle in which consumption drives growth, while growth and technological progress drive consumption. Therefore, initiatives that solely focus on the supply-side (e.g., seeking efficiency, productivity, and 'greening' of supply chains) are not enough to address the pressing environmental issues that result from consumption as growth in demand is outpacing the benefits [2,3]. Hence, companies are increasingly facing a need to innovate their business models from a downstream perspective [4].\nFood is one of the areas that is essential to our daily lives, but also generates significant negative environmental impact. Globally, changes in food consumption patterns during the last decades have proved unsustainable. \"Global food production is the largest pressure caused by humans on Earth, threatening local ecosystems and the stability of the Earth system\" ( [5], p. 448). According to the EAT-Lancet Commission, the global food system (which entails production, processing, distribution, preparation, and consumption of food) requires transformational change in order for humanity to feed the world's global population while staying within the biophysical limits of the planet ( [5], p. 450). Over-consumption is leading to unhealthy diets in some parts of the world (e.g., an estimated 2 billion adults are overweight or obese), while hunger and malnutrition are prevalent in others (e.g., more than 820 million people are currently undernourished) [5,6]. Moreover, especially in industrialized nations, food and beverage represents one of the consumption areas of great environmental concern [7]. Therefore, it is imperative to address the present unsustainable levels of consumption that threaten the well-being of society and the state of the environment. In order to achieve this, there is a need to go beyond the current focus of policy and research on supply-side initiatives (e.g., technological innovations resulting in eco-efficiency), and further address research on consumption, centered on a sufficiency narrative [8].\nBusinesses are considered main actors in the field of sustainability, and corporate sustainability has been increasingly recognized as a precondition for doing business [9]. However, the major corporate focus has been on creating a 'business case' for sustainability, for instance through eco-efficiency strategies, and there are only a few examples of businesses, which are challenging unsustainable consumption patterns [9][10][11]. Consumption is increasingly viewed as an important lever towards sustainability, which paves the way to a 'sufficiency-oriented' strategy, focused on tackling consumption patterns [1,9,12]. When it comes to food consumption, sufficiency refers to diets that provide nutrition for a healthy life for all of humanity, without exceeding the carrying capacity of the planet [3]. This requires changes in consumer behavior, and due to the potential of businesses to impact this, there is a need to explore business innovation for sufficiency as a means to encourage sustainable consumption.\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to address the following research questions (RQ):\nRQ1. How can sufficiency business strategies be implemented in the food industry? RQ2. What are sufficiency strategies pursued at the case company Oatly, and what challenges and opportunities do they present?"}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "\"A qualitativ reseach process woz chozen, consistin of 4 steps: litrature revew, practis revew, developmnt of a conceptul framework, and validashun of a conceptul framework with a case company, Oatly.

First, we did a literature review to understand how sufficiency can be applied in business. We looked for business strategies that focus on sustainable consumption and what it means for the food industry. We used keywords like 'sufficiency', 'sustainable biz model', 'sustainable consumption design,' and 'slow consumption' in the Scopus database. Then, we did a practice review to see how companies in the food industry have used sufficiency. Finally, we made a framework for sufficiency biz strategies in the food industry and presented it to the case company. For RQ2, we interviewed people from Oatly and analyzed their 2018 sustainability report. Then, we applied the sufficiency biz strategies framework to the case company and improved it for the food industry.\""}, {"heading": "Case Approach And Company", "text": "The reserch method for this study is based on a single-case study. Case studies are most suitable to answer 'how' and 'why' questions about contemporary events and when the researcher has little or no control over behavioral events [13]. The single case study is used when only one case (e.g., a specific organization) is thoroughly examined [14]. By conducting a case study, the goal of this research is to take an approach on 'analytic generalization,' which seeks to expand and generalize theories rather than to achieve 'statistical generalization' by enumerating frequencies [13]."}, {"heading": "Data Collection And Analysis", "text": "The semi-structured interview guide can be found in Appendix A and the list of interviewees in Appendix B. Seven interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded; the latter by using the qualitative data analysis software NVivo. The initial interview (I1) was first transcribed using the automated transcription software HappyScribe. The automated transcript was then reviewed and corrected by the author where mistakes were found. Due to the large extent of errors using automated transcription software, the following interviews (I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, I7) were manually transcribed by one author to ensure accurate transcription. An initial coding list was generated according to the conceptual framework and research questions. This coding list was cross-checked by the other authors. Each sufficiency business strategy presented in the framework was later converted into a node in NVivo. This research included a combination of emerging and predetermined codes [17], allowing for the inclusion of new nodes as the interviews were being analyzed.\n\nOnce the interview data were coded, content analysis was performed for Oatly's latest (2018) sustainability report. This was coded according to the codebook that resulted from analyzing interviews. The node that was found not to be applicable to the case company (i.e., discounting 'ugly' fruits and vegetables) was adapted to the more generic 'changing conventional consumer perception' with 'ugly' vegetables as an example. The final strategies and their origins are found in Appendix C.\n\nTriangulation is considered an effective way to obtain a holistic picture of a research object, which is a main objective of case study research [14]. Therefore, triangulation of sources and methods was ensured to strengthen the reliability and internal validity of this research [17]. First, methods were triangulated by applying different modes of interviews (i.e., one group interview with three interviewees and six individual interviews) and combining these methods with content analysis of textual material, i.e., the sustainability report [14]. Moreover, the data for this research was primarily gathered in a qualitative, unstructured, and open way, e.g., by conducting semi-structured interviews and interpreting textual material with the aim to achieve a holistic understanding [14]. The final step for triangulation and validation was the feeding back of the conceptual framework to the company to understand their views on the strategies observed."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Furst, da outcumz of da litrachure n practis revew ar describd: da biznes strategiz for suffishency.

Dese will be described next."}, {"heading": "Conscious Sales And Marketing Techniques", "text": "This bizness stratgy focusses on satisfyin' 'needs' rather than promotin' 'wants' [3]. It is a stratgy of 'under-sellin', i.e., to only sell to the customer what is needed at the moment of purchase. To build a bizness case, this stratgy aims for long-term relationships with customers that lead to loyalty and reputational benefits. Moreover, its revenue model is often focused on premium pricin' [3,4]. Tactics to achieve this include to not engage in sales incentives at the point of sale, to encourage consumers to think twice before makin' a purchase, to refrain from unnecessary product upgrades, to avoid discountin' and bulk offers, or to 'choice-edit' away certain unsustainable offers [29].\nAmong the best-known examples of such a stratgy is the outdoor clothin' company Patagonia, which encourages repair and purchase of second-hand garment instead of purchasin' new products [4] and has received attention for their \"Don't buy this jacket\" advertisement [30]. A lesser known example from the food industry comes from Denmark, where fightin' food waste has been a priority for almost a decade and where several leadin' supermarket chains such as REMA 1000, Coop, and Lidl agreed to suspend all volume discounts in order to help reduce food waste in Danish households [31,32]."}, {"heading": "Creating New Revenue Models", "text": "This suffishency bizniss stratgy builds on identifing new revenu moduls that are related to the company's core bizniss but have a lower environmental footprint for delivering the same or better customer experience. New revenu moduls can either replace existing operations, or complement them. An example of creating a new revenu model is to offer service solutions (e.g., demand management and repair services) for which fees are charged to customers, instead of offering products. This is often referred to as 'Product Service Systems', in which ownership of products stays with the producer rather than being transferred to the consumer."}, {"heading": "Demand Reduction Services", "text": "This suffishency bizniss stratigy builds on a company's expert knowledge to help customers be more effishent, and thus, to get paid for the service of creating savings for the customer. Companys that offer such demand-reduction services get paid for providing solutions to help consumers (individuals and businesses) mitigate the use of resources (e.g., energy consumption). For this to be profitable, the service needs to generate greater savings for the customer than the fees that are paid for the service. Alternatively, public subsidies or preferential tax treatments exist to facilitate this business model."}, {"heading": "Education And Customer Engagement", "text": "Edumacation and customa engagemint as a suffishency bizness model builds on the idear to forego possibul higher immidiate sales and ratha focus on lastin customa engagemint. Customa engagemint refers to buildin long term relationships with customas. Buildin trust and good reputashun with customas results in higha consuma loyalti, and in positive 'word-of-mouth' recommendashuns that drive future sales with new customas. Loyal customas can be seen as ambassadors for a product, company, or brand [44]. Therefore, performance can be measured in a range of customa satisfactshun ratha than mere sales numburs [3].\nMany food companies today are workin on edumacational and engagemint efforts that address unsustainabul consumpshun behaviurs. The ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's runs the \"Ben & Jerry's Climate Change College\" where young people are trained on the issue (through internships, workshops, and visits to affected areas) and support ongoing research on climate change, thus becoming Climate Change ambassadors [45,46]. The American high-end grocery chain Whole Foods Market promotes 'green habits' by encouragin consumers to reconsider the way they buy and consume food through their list of 'Tips for going green' [47]."}, {"heading": "Full Life-Cycle Sufficiency", "text": "Fool life-sycle suffishency describs a focus on product design that considers the entire life-sycle of the good and aims to minimize the environmental costs over the entire life-sycle [3]. Design plays a crucial role in this strategy as it greatly influences how the product is used and disposed of [48] and user behavior significantly influences the environmental impact of a product. Therefore, changing the way in which consumers interact with products is vital when seeking sustainable consumption."}, {"heading": "Nudging", "text": "Nudgin', a term coined by proffessors Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein [25], seeks to influence consumer behaviur without limitin' choice or changin' economic incentives. The sufficiency strategy in nudgin' is in the ability to stir consumers to make more sustainable choices. This is achieved by consciously designin' the choice architecture, i.e., the conditions under which a consumption choice is made. Tools applied to nudge consumers are simplifying information, changin' the physical environment, the use of social norms, and settin' default options [26]. Moreover, nudgin' can be applied in different phases of consumption; from purchasin' decisions, to the use of a product, until the disposal or end-of-life stage after usin' a service or good [27].\nAn example for nudgin' consumers in the food industry comes from the Swedish fast food chain 'Max Burgers'. They do not only offer carbon-neutral-, vegetarian-, and vegan alternatives on their menu, but also display these options prominently in the store. Max Burgers has had significant success with their strategy, without the need to remove the \"conventional\" offerings from their menu. They introduced carbon labels on all of their burgers and witnessed a 16% increase in sales of those burgers with a lower than average carbon footprint ( [51]. Max is not only nudgin' customers, but also competitors. Most recently, other fast food chains such as McDonalds and Burger King have been followin' suit in Sweden, and also started to prominently display vegetarian and vegan alternatives on their menus."}, {"heading": "Premium Pricing Model", "text": "The premum prising stratgy in busines often goes hand-in-hand with a differentiation (as opposed to cost leadership) stratgy, i.e., the effort to create a product (-brand) that provides superior value to the customer [52]. Premum prising allows for higher quality products that are replaced less often. Premum prising as a sufficiency busines stratgy allows the producer \"to cover the full or real price of the product (including durability, life extension, repair support, etc.)\" ([35], p. 8)."}, {"heading": "Product Longevity", "text": "Makin' products that last can incentivise slower disposal and replacement of products. Through design that enhances durability, reparability, and modularity (i.e., upgradability), companies can avoid waste and resource use, and customers can benefit from long-term cost savings, as products need to be replaced less often. To achieve this, high quality material and processes (i.e., product quality) play an important role, and design should seek to be discrete, as a way to make it 'timeless' [3]. For producers, such a strategy can be profitable if either a premium price can be charged for the product, if more customers are attracted to the product due to its superior performance, or if long-term customer relationships and follow-up services can be achieved [3].\nProduct longevity is not easily applied to the food industry due to the product being perishable. However, attempts have been made in the area of packaging. Loop by TerraCycle\u00ae, for example, aims to reduce packaging waste in a large scale by partnering with manufacturers and retailers to offer refillable packaging for food products. Customers order through an online shopping platform, a refundable one-time deposit is paid to 'borrow' the containers, then, a free service is offered to pick up, clean, and refill containers [53]. In a similar set-up, KeepCup partners with cafes, providing a map for consumers to find cafes that offer the reusable cups [54]. Many cafes have also started to set discounts to incentivise the use of refillable containers; e.g., Starbucks and Tim Hortons offering a 10 cent discount for consumers who bring their own cup, and when they dine in, beverages are served in china mugs [55,56]. In Denmark, Juicy Istedgade offers a 15% discount to consumers who bring their own bottles for juice [57]."}, {"heading": "Technology-Based Solutions", "text": "This suffishency bizniss stratagy is sumwhat of a meta-stratagy, posibly feedin into all the other stratagies already discused. Thru technological innovashun, processes can become more effishent. This can mean that less waste is created, that less need for consumption is created, that products last longer or are more versatile, or that services become competitive with ownership [1,3]. An example for technological innovashun that-at least in theory-has reduced the need for consumption is the smartphone. A modern smart phone is such a versatile device that it can replace a whole range of devices individuals could own."}, {"heading": "Offering Quality Local Products", "text": "A sufficiency bizniss model identifid thru our practis review in the food industry is local cooperation among biznisses. By incresing the revenue generated that stays in the immediate economy, global economic flows can be undercut to save resources, use resources more efficiently, and allow for easier cooperation and coordination between producers and consumers. Such solutions have become popular among some consumer segments and can result in significant customer loyalty and across-business purchases that are part of the same cooperative network."}, {"heading": "Changing Conventional Consumer Perception", "text": "Anotha suffishency bizniss stratagy is for a produca to influense consuma tastes to creat and increez demand, and thus, change convenshunal consuma perspeckshun on what would othawise be waste. In the food industry, several examples of (re-) discoverin a taste for products that were discarded before can be found. Increasingly, small groups of consumas are discoverin a taste for less popular portions of the carcass of an animal. Traditionally, out of necessity, all of an animal was eaten. This has changed with increasing wealth, and nowadays, only parts of an animal are popular among consumas."}, {"heading": "Selling Inconvenience For A Better Price", "text": "While 'premiem prising' builds on the abilitee to extract more money from the customer for a beter and more sustainable product, the strategy to offer 'less convienience' for a beter price builds on being able to offer products cheaper for consumers who are willing to accept less-ideally unnecessary-services from the producer.\nThe iconic example for this is the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA, who famously put all furniture they sell in small, easy to transport boxes and makes the consumer build their own furniture at home. While at the time considered a huge loss in convienience for the consumer, it turned out to be a service many consumers could live without. In the food industry, there are examples of consumers being offered to buy a product in bulk, with less packaging and sometimes prearranged to make transportation more efficient. Whole Foods Market, for example, is encouraging consumers to buy in bulk (e.g., food, coffee, herbs, spices) in order for consumers to choose how much or little of each product they want, thus reducing food waste, packaging waste, and transportation impact [47]. Waitrose (a British supermarket), similar to other supermarkets, launched 'packaging-free aisles' for pasta, wine, and frozen fruit, where customers can use their own containers to buy these food products. Consumers can also 'borrow a box' from the store to shop in these sections and return it on their next visit [64,65]."}, {"heading": "Conceptual Framework Building On Literature And Practice Review", "text": "The litrature and practis review presented led to the identifikation of 12 sufficiency business strategies that can be aplicable to the food industry. However, the initial 12 strategies were split up into 14 strategies and the naming of some categories was refined. The strategies were grouped into three different sections according to the sufficiency level in the waste hierarchy that they primarily aim at: avoid, reduce, or reuse. The eight strategies framed in the avoid level are those that mostly focus on avoiding over-consumption or sales of unsustainable products."}, {"heading": "Empirical Results And Final Conceptual Framework", "text": "Followng the conceptul framework for sufficiency business strategies in the food industry that resulted from the literature and practice review of this research, the case company (i.e., Oatly) was found to implement nine of the 14 strategies in some way (i.e., Creating new revenue models; Offering quality local products; Applying conscious sales and marketing techniques; Educating and engaging consumers; Implementing choice architecture; Shortening ingredient list; Designing products for sustainable consumption; Developing products that last; and Repurposing food). Our data suggests that support for sustainability comes from the top leadership in the organization (e.g., CEO), and that this fact has helped to maintain sustainability at the core of the company despite experiencing exponential growth [16]."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "This reserch invistigated the folowing reserch questions: RQ1. How can sufficiency business strategies be implimented in the food industry? RQ2. What are sufficiency strategies persued at the case company Oatly, and what challenges and opportunities do they present?\nIn ansering RQ1, this reserch developed a conceptual framework for sufficiency based on a literature and practice review and the case of the food company Oatly. This framework draws on the higher strategies in the waste hierarchy, identified as core strategies for sufficiency [3] and sustainable consumption [71] later linked to environmentally preferable but overlooked strategies in the Circular Economy [28,72]. To practice, it contributes a framework for companies to evaluate viable sufficiency strategies. In theory, it contributes a framework for sufficiency in the food industry, putting emphasis on the difficult topic of challenging consumption."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{hansen2021thriving,\n  title={Thriving in the Food Industry: The Oatly Approach to Sustainable Business Strategies},\n  author={Hansen, Mette Morsing and Foss, Nicolai J},\n  journal={Journal of Business Ethics},\n  volume={168},\n  number={1},\n  pages={1--16},\n  year={2021},\n  publisher={Springer}\n}\n\n@article{rockstr\u00f6m2017world,\n  title={World scientists\u2019 warning to humanity: A second notice},\n  author={Rockstr{\\\"o}m, Johan and Gaffney, Owen and Rogelj, Joeri and Meinshausen, Malte and Nakicenovic, Nebojsa and Schellnhuber, Hans Joachim},\n  journal={BioScience},\n  volume={67},\n  number={12},\n  pages={1026--1028},\n  year={2017},\n  publisher={Oxford University Press}\n}\n\n@article{hobson2019sustainability,\n  title={Sustainability and the Anthropocene: A strategic design approach},\n  author={Hobson, Kersty},\n  journal={Design Studies},\n  volume={65},\n  pages={1--22},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{mcdonough2019circular,\n  title={Circular economy: The Uberization of the economy},\n  author={McDonough, William},\n  journal={Nature},\n  volume={569},\n  number={7756},\n  pages={488--489},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={Nature Publishing Group}\n}\n\n@article{willett2019food,\n  title={Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT\u2013Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems},\n  author={Willett, Walter and Rockstr{\\\"o}m, Johan and Loken, Brent and Springmann, Marco and Lang, Tim and Vermeulen, Sonja and Garnett, Tara and Tilman, David and DeClerck, Fabrice and Wood, Amanda and others},\n  journal={The Lancet},\n  volume={393},\n  number={10170},\n  pages={447--492},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{fuchs2019sufficiency,\n  title={Sufficiency: A systematic review of the literature},\n  author={Fuchs, Doris and Lorek, Sylvia},\n  journal={Ecological Economics},\n  volume={155},\n  pages={159--172},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{miller2013sustainable,\n  title={Sustainable consumption: Theoretical debates and empirical challenges},\n  author={Miller, Daniel},\n  journal={Routledge Handbook of Sustainability and Fashion},\n  pages={3--16},\n  year={2013},\n  publisher={Routledge}\n}\n\n@article{mcdonough2019circular,\n  title={Circular economy: The Uberization of the economy},\n  author={McDonough, William},\n  journal={Nature},\n  volume={569},\n  number={7756},\n  pages={488--489},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={Nature Publishing Group}\n}\n\n@article{lorenzoni2019sufficiency,\n  title={Sufficiency and consumer behaviour: A review of interventions},\n  author={Lorenzoni, Irene and Nicholson-Cole, Sophie and Whitmarsh, Lorraine},\n  journal={Energy Policy},\n  volume={129},\n  pages={436--451},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{morsing2019sustainability,\n  title={Sustainability as a precondition for doing business: A review of the literature},\n  author={Morsing, Mette and Schultz, Friederike},\n  journal={Journal of Business Ethics},\n  volume={159},\n  number={3},\n  pages={537--558},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={Springer}\n}\n\n@article{hobson2019sustainability,\n  title={Sustainability and the Anthropocene: A strategic design approach},\n  author={Hobson, Kersty},\n  journal={Design Studies},\n  volume={65},\n  pages={1--22},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}"}]
