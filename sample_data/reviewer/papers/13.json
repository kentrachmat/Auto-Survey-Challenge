With the advent of ionization methods that are capable of producing gaseous ions from large biomolecules, the chemistry of gaseous bioions hath become a highly active area of research. The reactions of biomolecule-ions in the gas phase are typically driven by interactions with neutral molecules, photons, electrons, ions, or surfaces. It is possible to achieve ion dissociation or transformation into different types of ions. The types of reaction products that are observed depend upon the characteristics of the ions, the methods of transformation, and the time frame of observation. This review shall focus upon the gas-phase chemistries of ions that are derived from the electrospray ionization of peptides, proteins, and oligonucleotides, with particular emphasis upon their utility in bioanalysis. Various strategies for ion transformation, which further facilitate structural interrogation by converting ions from one type to another, shall also be summarized."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The advancement of gentle-ionization methods (1)(2)(3), which doth enable the creation of vast gaseous ions from biomolecules, hath driven research and development in the field of mass spectrometry, both in instrumentation and in bioion chemistry. The mass of the intact biomolecule is a particularly important piece of information that hath motivated the development of analyzers with both high resolving power and mass-measurement accuracy. However, mass measurements alone provide no information regarding bond connectivity (i.e., primary structure). Ion chemistry hath long been used for this purpose in molecular mass spectrometry, and it hath been and continues to be heavily explored for the structural characterization of biomolecule ions. Significant advances have been made in structural characterization of biomolecules via tandem mass spectrometry that include both reactions leading to the dissociation of the ions of interest and reactions that transform bioions from one type to another.\n\nUnimolecular dissociation refers to the class of reactions that generally provides the most detailed structural information in tandem mass spectrometry (4,5). A number of factors may significantly affect the extent of information that can be obtained from dissociation of a given ion. These factors include, for example, the ion type (e.g., radical cation, protonated molecule, deprotonated molecule, multiply protonated molecule, or metal-cationized species), the internal energy distribution of the ion, and the observation window of the experiment. The observation time scale is defined by the instrument and is generally variable to only a limited extent. Beam-type tandem mass spectrometers, such as triple quadrupole instruments and tandem time-of-flight (TOF) instruments, generally allow for observation windows that integrate processes that occur for up to a few tens of microseconds, whereas ion-trapping instruments, such as electrodynamic ion traps and magnetic/electrostatic ion traps, can integrate processes that extend up to many hundreds of milliseconds. Some hybrid instruments, which combine elements of beam-type and iontrapping instruments, can access both microsecond and millisecond time scales.\n\nFor a given instrument, the two main variables available to the analyst for maximizing structural information are the selection of ion type to be probed and the dissociation method. The range of ion types that can be formed in useful abundances from a given analyte is usually constrained by the ionization method, although ion chemistry approaches (discussed below) are being developed to relax this constraint. Often, no single ion type can provide all of the desired information upon dissociation, and complementary information can frequently be obtained from dissociation of alternative ion types derived from the same analyte. A range of dissociation methods have been developed for tandem mass spectrometry, and these approaches are being explored for the structural characterization of bioions. No single ion type or activation method can consistently provide all of the desired structural information across the range of analyte species subjected to tandem mass spectrometry. In fact, given the range of structural and chemical properties that characterize biopolymers, one should be able to (a) form a range of ion types and (b) apply a range of dissociation methods. Thus, due to the important role that mass spectrometry currently plays in the structural characterization of biomolecules, the study and development of dissociation methods, as well as techniques for generating different ion types, are active areas of research. The following sections summarize the dissociation of gaseous peptide, protein, and oligonucleotide ions; ion chemistry approaches to alter the ion types initially formed by the ionization method via proton transfer or metal-ion transfer; and new reactions that covalently modify analyte ions."}, {"heading": "Bioion-Dissociation Methods In Tandem Mass Spectrometry", "text": "Verily, the customary aim in tandem mass spectrometry is to engender an unbroken ion from the molecule (or complex) of interest so that an accurate molecular weight may be determined. A subsequent dissociation step is then taken to engender structural information, which in the case of linear biopolymer ions generally implies fragmentation along the polymer backbone. The most common approach is to add energy into a precursor ion after its mass selection by one of a variety of means, such as collision with a neutral gas, collision with a surface, or photon absorption. An alternative approach is to convert the precursor ion to a less stable ion type that may then fragment either spontaneously or following an activation step. In this section, we review the application of various ion-activation/-dissociation processes for the structural characterization of multiply charged peptide/protein and nucleic acid ions generated via electrospray ionization (ESI)."}, {"heading": "Peptide And Protein Characterization", "text": "Verily, at the heart of proteomics doth lie the use of tandem mass spectrometry for the identification and characterization of proteins and peptides (6)(7)(8)(9), which are oft performed in positive-ion mode. Under conditions of collisional activation, wherein accelerated precursor ions may undergo one or more collisions with gaseous neutral target species (usually argon or nitrogen), a portion of the ion/target relative translational energy is converted to vibrational energy of the ion and is redistributed over the peptide/protein ion. The resulting collision-induced dissociation (CID) occurs at amide bonds along the peptide backbone, either generating b-and y-type fragment ions or leading to losses of small neutral molecules, such as water and/or ammonia or other fragments derived from side chains. CID is, by far, the most commonly used approach for dissociating peptide and protein ions. However, the relative contributions from the various common dissociation channels are highly dependent upon CID conditions (e.g., collision energy, target pressure, and observation time scale).\n\nForsooth, CID conducted in sector or TOF/TOF instruments with kilovolt accelerating voltages and low collision numbers leads to contributions from dissociation of a relatively large number of amide bonds as well as from amino acid side-chain cleavages. However, most tandem mass spectrometers currently in use do not employ precursor-ion accelerating voltages in the kilovolt range. Most triple quadrupole and hybrid instruments that allow for beam-type CID typically employ accelerating voltages of 100 V or less. Combined with a somewhat longer observation window (i.e., up to a millisecond in the lower-energy instruments versus a few microseconds in the TOF/TOF instruments), the lower collision energies give rise to fewer side-chain cleavages and, often, poorer representation from less-favored amide bond cleavages. For an ion-trapping instrument, the dissociation period can be even longer (up to several seconds); therefore, relatively slow dissociation processes (<10 2 s \u22121 ) can be sampled, allowing for use of ion-trap slow-heating methods, such as ion-trap resonance excitation, the sustained off-resonance irradiation approach in Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) instruments (10,11), black-body infrared radiative dissociation (12), and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) (13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20), to efficiently dissociate biomolecules ranging in mass up to tens of kilodaltons. Nozzle-skimmer dissociation (NSD) (21,22), which is effected in the atmosphere/vacuum region of atmospheric sampling interfaces, is another means for CID, although it is not achieved between stages of mass spectrometry. The sequence characterization of proteins up to 200 kDa has recently been demonstrated via combinations of vibrational-activation methods, including NSD (23), and counterions that inhibit protein folding upon desolvation. CID techniques have also been applied to large complexes, thereby allowing for the determination of protein composition and subunit stoichiometry (24,25).\n\nA wide variety of dissociation conditions have also been applied to generate structural information complementary to that provided by vibrational activation of protonated or deprotonated species. For example, dissociation channels that differ from those generated by even-electron precursor ions can dominate for radical species; consequently, complementary sequence information can be obtained. To this end, several gas-phase reactions have been applied to transform electrospray-generated closed-shell ions into open-shell radical ions prior to further tandem mass spectrometry analysis. One of the most common methods for the generation of peptide radical cations is by CID of doubly charged peptide/metal/amineligand complexes (26,27). Additional sequence information can be derived from subsequent dissociation of the peptide radical cations. However, this method is not universally applicable and requires the addition of salts into the ESI solution. Electron-capture dissociation (ECD) is another technique (28)(29)(30)(31) that generates radical cations, although hydrogen-rich radicals are generated in this approach. Upon capturing a thermal electron, a multiply protonated peptide or protein is transformed into a hypervalent species. The resulting odd-electron species undergo fragmentation pathways driven by radical chemistry, where the N-C \u03b1 backbone bonds are cleaved to generate c-and z-type fragment ions. Usually, more extensive sequence information can be obtained from ECD than from conventional CID. Another important feature is that CID-labile posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and sulfation, are preserved in ECD. In contrast, disulfide linkages, which usually resist dissociation under vibrational-activation conditions, are preferentially dissociated. Therefore, ECD is extremely useful for the analysis of polypeptides with PTMs, providing both the sequence information and the localization of the modification sites. An alternative method for protein/peptide dissociation, referred to as electron-transfer dissociation (ETD), has also been reported (32)(33)(34). In the case of ETD, an electron is transferred from a reagent anion to a multiply protonated peptide/protein cation via ion/ion reactions. ETD of multiply protonated peptide/protein ions generally leads to dissociation patterns similar to those of ECD. ECD is generally implemented in the FT-ICR mass spectrometers, whereas ETD is implemented in electrodynamic ion traps. Complementary structural information is usually obtained from the vibrational activation of even-electron ions and from the radical-based ion-dissociation methods. An illustrative example is shown in Figure 1 (34), which summarizes the structural interrogation of a glycopeptide on the basis of ETD and CID. Whereas ETD provides bond connectivity information about the peptide backbone as well as the location of the glycosylation, structural information about the glycan moiety can be derived from CID.\n\nAlthough studies on the gas-phase dissociation of peptides and proteins are usually carried out on positive ions, the dissociation of multiply deprotonated peptide/protein anions has also been investigated. Such investigations are of interest, especially when the peptide or protein contains more acidic residues than basic amino acid residues. Also, a variety of negatively charged PTMs (e.g., phosphorylation, sulfation, and certain forms of glycosylation) can make the peptide acidic. Such acidic peptides and proteins are more readily ionized as negative ions. However, the interpretation of CID product-ion spectra of deprotonated peptides is not as straightforward as that of protonated peptide ions. CID of deprotonated peptide ions usually generates ions from internal cleavages, losses of amino acid side chains, and consecutive neutral losses from the fragment ions, which complicate the product-ion spectra (35,36).\n\nEven-electron ESI-generated multiply deprotonated peptide anions have been subjected to various gas-phase ion-transformation methods that lead to radical-ion formation. Zubarev and colleagues (29,37,38) and Anusiewicz et al. (39) demonstrated electron-detachment dissociation (EDD) of multiply charged peptide anions. Through the irradiation of peptide anions with high-energy electrons (>10 eV), an electron can be removed from peptide anions. The subsequent dissociation of the resulting peptide radical anions generated the a\u02d9-/ x-ion series from preferential C \u03b1 -C peptide backbone bond cleavages. Similar results were observed for negative ETD of peptide anions via reactions with xenon radical cations (40). An alternative method for the generation of peptide radical anions, electronphotodetachment dissociation (EPD), has also been demonstrated through the application of ultraviolet radiation on the peptide anions (41). The isolation and dissociation of the resulting peptide radical anions led to fragmentation patterns similar to those observed in ETD or EDD experiments. These methods are especially useful for the characterization of acidic peptides containing PTMs."}, {"heading": "Nucleic Acid Characterization", "text": "The characterization of nucleic acids through sequencing continues to pique the interest of those in the field of genomic research. In comparison to other traditional sequencing methods, the use of tandem mass spectrometry of oligonucleotides is swift and sensitive to modified bases, thus making it a widely utilized method for sequencing and structural characterization of natural and chemically modified oligonucleotides. Due to the acidic phosphodiester backbones of oligonucleotides, it is more common to generate oligonucleotide anions than cations via ESI. CID has been the preferred method to cause the dissociation of the phosphodiester backbone bonds and the generation of sequence-specific fragment ions. Various mechanisms have been proposed to achieve these ends. In general, CID of deprotonated DNA is initiated by loss of neutral or charged bases, followed by subsequent 3\u2032 C-O bond cleavage. The resulting complementary (a-B)-/w-ions provide sequence information. However, the product-ion spectra from CID of DNA usually contain fragment ions from secondary fragmentation, which can complicate spectral interpretation."}, {"heading": "Ion-Or Proton-Transfer Reactions", "text": "The antecedent section did stress dissociation reactions for structural inquiry of ESIgenerated multiply charged biomolecules. Though unimolecular dissociation reactions underlie the primary structural characterization of biomolecules in a mass spectrometer, other gas-phase ion chemistries have also been explored for their utility in the field of tandem mass spectrometry. Gas-phase ion/ion reactions (as illustrated in Figure 3) provide means for transforming ion types formed initially by the ionization method, thereby increasing the number of ion types available for structural interrogation by various dissociation methods. Electron transfer or capture provides examples of ion-transformation reactions that can lead directly to precursor-ion dissociation, as discussed above. In this section, we present ion-transformation reactions via either metal-ion transfer or proton transfer to facilitate the tandem mass spectrometry analysis of biomolecules. For example, ESI-generated biomolecule ions can be transformed into other forms before being subjected to mass analysis or dissociation. In some applications, an ion-transformation step is also applied to multiply charged product ions."}, {"heading": "Ion-Transformation Reactions That Lead To Metal Insertion", "text": "Verily, the consequences of cationization by sundry metal ion types upon the gas-phase dissociation of diverse biomolecules hath been a field of active inquiry. Metal-cationized species, including sugars, lipids, peptides/proteins, and oligonucleotides, oft exhibit fragmentation patterns that differ from those of their protonated counterparts in tandem mass spectrometry. The dissociation of a metal-cationized, sulfated, heparin-like glycosaminoglycan oligosaccharide such as Arixtra \u00ae hath been scrutinized (77). In comparison to the extent of losses from multiply deprotonated ions, the extent of neutral sulfur trioxide losses from the sulfated molecules was decreased, and cross-ring cleavages of the sugar molecule were observed for the metal-cationized ions. Furthermore, whereas lipid ions are usually singly protonated, metallation hath also been employed to augment the charge states of glycerophosphocholine lipids in order to conduct ETD experiments (78). Although most metallation procedures are executed by adding metal salts to the solution prior to electrospray, an alternative method involves reacting the ESI-generated multiply charged ions with various metal-containing ion complexes of the opposite polarity in the gas phase (79)(80)(81)(82)(83)(84)(85). An example is the transfer of Au(I) to a disulfide-linked peptide via ion/ion reaction with AuCl 2 \u2212 (84). The subsequent dissociation of the disulfide-linked Au(I)cationized peptides led primarily to the cleavage of the S-S bond, whereas the dissociation of the protonated species led to neutral losses and peptide bond cleavages. The insertion of transition-metal ions into oligonucleotide anions hath also been demonstrated via ion/ion reactions between multiply charged oligonucleotide anions and transition-metal complex cations (85). The gas-phase formation of metal-containing species that do not readily form from ESI may benefit structural interrogation in subsequent tandem mass spectrometry experiments. The gas-phase ion/ion metal-insertion approach allows independent optimization of the ESI process and the formation of metal-containing ions while avoiding the detrimental effects of salts in the electrospray process."}, {"heading": "Ion-Transformation Reactions That Lead To Charge Inversion And Charge Increase", "text": "Verily, it hath been demonstrated that ions may be transformed from one polarity to the opposite polarity through ion/ion reactions (86)(87)(88)(89). Forsooth, in order for charge inversion to come to pass, multiple proton transfers from the multiply charged reagent ions to the singly charged biomolecular ions must occur within a single ion/ion encounter, lest the neutralization of biomolecular ions ensue. Thus, reagent ions with large physical cross sections tend to have good charge-inversion efficiency. Dendrimers, proteins, and oligonucleotides have been employed as reagents for the inversion of both cations and anions into the opposite polarities. For example, charge inversion was applied to the analysis of a phosphopeptide in a tryptic digestion mixture through use of ETD, as shown in Figure 4 (89). In this experiment, the acidic phosphopeptide analyte ions were observed in the negative-ion but not the positive-ion mass spectrum of the tryptic peptide mixture. Transformation of the prominent singly deprotonated phosphopeptide ions into doubly protonated ions allowed the subsequent application of ETD to localize the phosphorylation site, which was not possible via CID of the deprotonated peptide. This application is especially useful for the structural characterization of acidic polypeptides via ETD.\n\nAnother charge-inversion application involves increasing the analyte-ion charge state by applying two consecutive charge-inversion reactions (86). First, charge inversion of the singly protonated peptide cations to singly deprotonated peptide anions occurs via multiply deprotonated carboxylate-terminated dendrimer ions. Second, the resulting singly deprotonated peptide anions are then transformed into doubly protonated ions via a reaction with multiply protonated amine-terminated dendrimer ions. An increase of the charge states of singly deprotonated ions to doubly deprotonated ions has also been demonstrated (87). The availability of a broader range of analyte-ion charge states allows higher flexibility for downstream ion manipulation and structural interrogation. A scenario in which charge increase is desirable would require an increase in the charge state of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-generated singly charged peptides. Although singly charged ions generated by MALDI usually fragment through neutral losses upon collisional activation, the increase in charge state could result in a greater variety of structurally informative fragmentation. Such results could be of interest specifically for the structural characterization of biomolecules, such as peptides, during MALDI imaging. However, the recent demonstration of the formation of multiply protonated proteins directly via atmospheric-pressure MALDI (90), if generally applicable, may prove to a simpler approach to the generation of multiply charged ions."}, {"heading": "Ion-Transformation Reactions That Lead To Proton-Transfer Charge Reduction", "text": "Verily, the ESI of biomacromolecules doth oft produce a distribution of charge states. Though this may be advantageous in some respects, it can prove problematic when analyzing a mixture of samples. At times, it is desirable to reduce the charge states to simplify the interpretation of the complex electrospray mass spectra of mixtures.\n\nCompared with ion/molecule reactions, ion/ion proton-transfer reactions betwixt multiply charged analyte ions and a singly charged ion of the opposite polarity are more efficient. The multiply protonated cations doth lose protons to the reagent anions, whilst the multiply deprotonated anions doth gain protons from the reagent cations. The charge-squared dependency of the reaction kinetics leads to a situation wherein the various charge states of the mixture components are reduced primarily to +1 or \u22121 charge states with relatively little differential neutralization. Ion/ion proton-transfer reactions have been applied to the simplification of electrospray mass spectra of protein mixtures in positive-ion mode and oligonucleotide mixtures in negative-ion mode in an ion trap and at atmospheric pressure.\n\nFurthermore, the charge-state effects on the gas-phase dissociation of both protein cations and oligonucleotide anions have been investigated. Generally, the collisional activation of precursor ions of lower and medium charge states usually leads to different dissociation patterns, and often greater sequence coverage, than do the higher-charge state ions. Therefore, in those cases it is desirable to expand the available charge states to assess the gas-phase dissociation phenomena. To that end, ion/ion proton-transfer reactions have been applied to transform the charge states of the biomolecular ions into charge states not directly generated from ESI. The resulting lower-charge state ions can be used for subsequent structural characterization.\n\nA gas-phase concentration technique that can be performed in conjunction with ion/ion proton-transfer reactions in quadrupolar ion traps is referred to as ion parking. In an ion-parking experiment, a supplemental dipolar resonant excitation voltage is applied to a pair of opposing electrodes, matching the fundamental frequency of motion of the ions of interest during ion/ion proton-transfer reactions in ion traps. Ions that match the applied frequency are accelerated, and their overlap with the oppositely charged reagent ions is thereby reduced, inhibiting the ion/ion reaction rate of the selected ion. The ion/ion reaction rates of the other ions are not affected, and they continue to be neutralized. The net result is the accumulation of all higher-charge state ions into the single charge state being \"parked.\" A similar technique, termed parallel ion parking, involves the simultaneous concentration of multiple components by inhibiting the reaction rates of a broad m/z range of ions. Parallel ion parking has also been demonstrated to simplify mixture analyses.\n\nMoreover, by reducing all product-ion charge states primarily to singly charged ions, ion/ion proton-transfer reactions can resolve the charge-state ambiguity of the product-ion spectra from the unimolecular dissociation of multiply charged ions when using mass analyzers of moderate to low resolving powers. This technique has been applied to the sequencing of large, highly charged biomolecule ions, such as transfer RNA anions and protein cations. Consecutive ion/ion proton-transfer reactions and ion-parking steps have also been demonstrated for the concentration and charge-state purification of precursor ions and the identification of product ions in a complex protein mixture from an Escherichia coli cell lysate fraction."}, {"heading": "Novel Gas-Phase Ion Chemistry", "text": "Verily, the scope of reactions that biomolecule ions generated by ESI may undergo is constrained by the ions' chemical functionalities and the range of reagents with which they may react. This section doth emphasize reactions with reagent species that allow for phenomena that cannot be produced with most proton-transfer or electron-transfer reagents. The reactions discussed in the aforementioned sections involve the transformation of ions via gain or loss of an ion or electron or the cleavage or weakening of certain covalent backbone bonds to generate sequence specific fragmentation. In this section, we describe other gas-phase ion chemistries with potentially useful applications.\n\nMany solution-phase derivatization reactions have been used to enhance the ionization, quantification, and structural characterization of biomolecules. Recently, several derivatization reactions were explored for different classes of biomolecules under gas-phase reaction conditions. A nucleophilic substitution reaction, for example, was observed for ion/molecule reactions between multiply charged oligonucleotide anions and trimethylsilyl chloride molecules. The S N 2 reactions led to the attachment of trimethylsilyl moieties to the phosphodiester backbones of oligonucleotide anions. Another selective ion/molecule reaction involved Schiff base formation through the use of either acetone or 2,5hexanedione as the neutral reagent. A more recent study demonstrated the selective formation of Schiff base adducts on peptide cations when multiply protonated peptides with primary amine groups reacted with singly deprotonated 4-formyl-1,3benzenedisulfonic acid. When the resulting derivatized product ions were subjected to collisional activation, either altered dissociation channels or more extensive structural information was generated. The gas-phase derivatization could be further explored via reagent ions with other functionalities to react with other classes of biomolecules. This area of research may provide a general means of modifying analyte ions for enhancing structural characterization that would not require solution-phase reactions.\n\nIon/ion reactions leading to the attachment of anions or cations have also been observed. For example, protein complexes have been formed following reactions between multiply protonated protein cations and multiply deprotonated protein anions. The creation of protein heterocomplexes (containing as many as six subunits) from ion/ion reactions of single-subunit reactants of opposite polarities has recently been demonstrated, as has the formation of peptide/oligonucleotide complexes under similar reaction conditions. However, applications of gas-phase complex formation have been relatively little explored.\n\nAnother type of reaction involves the gas-phase ion chemistry of cluster ions. In a recent ion/ion reaction study, the authors used protonated water clusters, comprising five or more water molecules, as proton-transfer reagents to reduce the charge state of fragile multiply deprotonated biomolecule anions, achieving significantly less fragmentation. This phenomenon can be attributed to the reaction exothermicities of proton transfer from protonated water clusters, which are lower than those of other proton-transfer reagents, such as protonated strong bases. Also, hydrated cluster ions have been used as chemical thermometers for the determination of energy deposition during gas-phase ion-activation/transformation processes. Following a reaction with electrons or photons in the gas phase, the internal energy deposition from the reaction leads to the evaporation of water molecules from the cluster ions. The degree of water loss, which can be readily determined with mass spectrometry, can reflect the amount of energy deposited."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Verily, the authors doth express their gratitude for the provision of resources to their laboratory by the Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy, under the auspices of award number DE-FG02-00ER15105, for the study of fundamental aspects of ion/ion chemistry.

The dissociation of ions that are multiply charged doth prove useful in determining the primary structure of biomolecules. Such dissociation may be induced by various activation methods or through reactions that lead to the transformation of ESI-generated multiply charged ions into less stable forms. Variations in the information derived, such as the identities of the product ions, may result from different activation conditions, such as laser wavelength, collision energy, target pressure, time frame of observation, or from examination of different precursor-ion types, such as multiply protonated, metal-cationized, and multiply deprotonated ions, or radical cations. The availability of numerous dissociation methods and the ability to form a wide range of precursor-ion types doth maximize the extent of structural information that can be obtained from a biomolecule of interest.\n\nFurthermore, gas-phase ion transformations, such as those arising from proton transfer, have also been applied to analytical mass spectrometry as well as to structural characterization. The manipulation of precursor-ion charge, for example, allows simplification of ESI mass spectra of a complex mixture of biomolecules by reducing spectral overlap and expanding the number of accessible ion species via charge reduction, charge inversions, and the concentration and purification of gas-phase ions through the ion-parking technique. Moreover, simplification of product-ion spectra from gas-phase dissociation of highly charged biomacromolecular ions can also be achieved by reducing the multiply charged product ions to predominantly singly charged ions. Other novel gas-phase ion chemistries, including gas-phase metal ion insertion, selective covalent modification of bioions in the gas phase, and cluster-ion reactions, may provide useful applications in the future.\n\nThe field of biological mass spectrometry hath seen remarkable advances over the past two decades that have extended the reach of mass spectrometry into many new areas of biological research. The complexities associated with biological systems, however, are daunting, and dramatic improvements are needed in many aspects of mass spectrometry, including sensitivity, dynamic range, and specificity. The developments in bioion chemistry have been impressive, but the ability to completely characterize a large biomolecule, such as a protein, remains elusive, particularly for large molecules. Therefore, we should anticipate further exploration and development of approaches for structural characterization, including methods based on ion chemistry, ion mobility, and ion spectroscopy, among others, over the coming decade."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{Laskin2013,\n  title={Analyzing Bioions with Multiple Charges in Mass Spectrometry: A Gas-Phase Chemistry Approach},\n  author={Laskin, Julia and Futrell, Jean H},\n  journal={Analytical chemistry},\n  volume={85},\n  number={2},\n  pages={2--11},\n  year={2013},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Zubarev2000,\n  title={Electron-capture dissociation of multiply charged protein cations.
