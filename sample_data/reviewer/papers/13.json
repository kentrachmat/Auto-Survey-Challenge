        "text": "This study focuses on the teaching, curriculum, and methods used by teachers in the science learning process for students with special needs in Indonesia. The research was conducted using qualitative methods and the subjects were students with visual impairments, hearing impairments, intellectual disabilities, and physical impairments at a special school in Kuningan. The study found that most teachers use the government-provided curriculum and some use lecture and question and answer methods. However, these methods are not effective for students with special needs who require concrete media and methods that accommodate their needs. As a result, student achievement is low."

        "heading": "Introduction",
        "text": "Special education in Indonesia has undergone a paradigm shift from a medical perspective to a social perspective. The government provides opportunities for all children to receive education, including those with special needs. Science education is an important unit that involves various elements to obtain information and achieve a change that is closely related to the environment of human life. Teachers at special schools teach natural science learning based on the curriculum provided by the government. However, teachers should make a learning process plan that is tailored to the conditions and needs of students at school. Currently, there is a lack of research on education and the science learning process for students with special needs in special schools. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify and inform the teaching, curriculum, and methods used in the science learning process for children with special needs in special schools in Indonesia. This study aims to provide evaluation and development material for further research."

        "heading": "Definition Of Children With Special Needs In Indonesia",
        "text": "Children with special needs face obstacles and problems that affect their learning process in everyday life. These children can be categorized into permanent and temporary special needs. Children with permanent special needs include those with visual impairments, hearing impairments, and intellectual disabilities. Children with visual impairments require special educational services to aid their education and life. They are divided into two categories: those with low vision and those who are blind. Children with hearing impairments lose part or all of their hearing power, which affects their verbal communication. Children with intellectual disabilities have below-average intelligence and struggle with adaptive behavior, making it difficult for them to complete tasks in everyday life. It is important to provide these children with the necessary support and resources to help them overcome their challenges and succeed in life."

        "text": "Children with limb or physical impairments, emotional and behavioral disorders, specific learning disorders, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are all children with permanent disabilities or neurological disorders. These conditions can significantly impact a child's development and ability to learn. However, there are also children with temporary special needs who experience learning and developmental ties due to environmental situations and conditions. It is important to provide support and accommodations for all children with special needs to ensure they have equal opportunities to succeed."

        "heading": "Special Education System In Indonesia",
        "text": "The special education system in Indonesia has gone through three stages: segregation, integration, and inclusive education. Segregation involves separating children with special needs from the general education system. In Indonesia, this is done through special education units or Special Schools (SLB). Integration, on the other hand, involves moving a student to an environment that is not too separate, such as a special unit or class within a regular school. Inclusive education is an approach that aims to remove barriers that can hinder every student from fully participating in education. This change benefits not only children with special needs but all children, parents, teachers, school administrators, and society as a whole. While segregation may have been necessary in the past, inclusive education is the way forward for a more equitable and accessible education system."

        "heading": "Science Education",
        "text": "Science education is a crucial unit that involves various elements to obtain information and achieve a change closely related to the environment of human life. Science is a body of knowledge that contains a collection of observations and research that explain what, why, and how a phenomenon occurs. There are several main domains of science at the primary and secondary education levels, namely physics, biology, chemistry, and earth and space sciences. In a narrow sense, science is a scientific discipline consisting of physical sciences and life sciences. The scope of science itself has limitations, namely on things that can be understood by the senses such as taste, sight, and hearing."

        "heading": "Demographics Of Students With Special Needs In Kuningan Indonesia",
        "text": "Our study focused on 50 students with special needs at the Special School in Kuningan, Indonesia. Through interviews, observations, and documentation, we found that 10% of students have visual impairment, 12% have hearing impairment, 70% have intellectual disabilities, and 8% have physical or muscular impairment. These findings highlight the prevalence of intellectual disabilities among students with special needs in Kuningan. It is important for educators and policymakers to prioritize resources and support for this group of students to ensure they receive the necessary education and accommodations to succeed."

        "heading": "Science Learning Curriculum For Students With Special Needs",
        "text": "The Special School in Kuningan follows the national curriculum for science education, using teacher and student books that outline the learning process of natural science. The curriculum is based on the 2013 curriculum and integrates various subjects into a chapter on the learning theme. The content of the science education curriculum for students with disabilities is similar to that of students in regular schools, with the only difference being the timing and level of instruction. Some teachers teach students with different types of barriers in one class, using a different book. However, most teachers generalize the process of learning science in the classroom, even though it would be better for them to create their own curriculum tailored to the needs of the child while still following the national curriculum."

        "heading": "Learning Methods Used For Students With Special Needs",
        "text": "The lecture and question and answer method used by most teachers in a special school in Indonesia for science learning is not effective. This is because most students get low learning outcomes. Teachers rarely use inquiry learning methods because they assume that students with special needs cannot learn complex science. However, if teachers use concrete learning media that are in accordance with children's needs, it will make it easier for children to understand science learning material."

    {
        "heading": "Summary",
        "text": "Students with special needs require special education and services in their learning process. Teachers in special schools should create a curriculum that is tailored to the needs of the children and still refers to the national curriculum. The science learning method used by the teacher should be adapted to the material and the needs of students with special needs."

        "heading": "Conclusion",
        "text": "The study conducted in Kuningan, Indonesia focused on the demographics, curriculum, and learning methods for students with special needs. The analysis revealed that the special school had a diverse range of special needs among the 50 students, with 10% having visual impairment, 12% having hearing impairment, 70% having intellectual disabilities, and 8% having physical or muscular impairment. The special school followed the national curriculum outlined in teacher books and student books, but there were slight differences in terms of timing and level of content delivery compared to general students in regular schools. The learning methods employed in science education for students with special needs predominantly involved lecture-style teaching and question-and-answer sessions, which led to lower learning outcomes for most students. The study suggests the need for further exploration of innovative teaching methods that engage students and promote better learning outcomes in science education for students with special needs."
