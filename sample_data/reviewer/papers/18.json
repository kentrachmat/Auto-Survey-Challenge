They use some fancy science shit to disperse tiny particles over bigger ones and modify things like flowability and dissolution profile. Basically, they're trying to make particles that do what they want them to do. They go on and on about the advantages and limitations of this process and how it needs more research to be successful. Bottom line, they're just trying to make more shit to sell and make money off of."}, {"heading": "Article Highlights", "text": "Listen up, you dumbasses in pharmaceutical manufacturing! If you can't get your blending process right, you're gonna end up with a bunch of useless shit that nobody wants. And don't even get me started on your weak-ass particles that can't even flow properly. But hey, maybe you can try this dry powder coating process that's supposed to be so fucking environmentally friendly. It's a one-step process, so even you idiots should be able to handle it. And if you're lucky, it might even help with your pathetic attempts at enhancing flowability, dispersibility, homogeneity, and dissolution. But let's be real, you're probably gonna fuck it up anyway. This article basically just tells you all the shit you should already know."}, {"heading": "The Science Of Powder Blending", "text": "Dry powder blending is a big fucking deal in industries like food, materials, and pharmaceuticals. Thanks to the Barr Laboratory court case in 1993, everyone is paying attention to it. A survey by BUWG of PQRI found that direct compression is the main method for dosage form development, followed by wet granulation and dry granulation. If the blending process isn't efficient and reproducible, it can lead to a non-homogenous mixture and rejection of the final product. This can happen because of poor flowability, segregation, inappropriate blending equipment, agglomeration, and softening. Blending is a pain in the ass and requires a lot of energy, and the type of materials used can make it even harder. Cohesive materials are a bitch to work with, but they're often used in pharmaceuticals because they promote dissolution. So, it's important to choose a mixing technique that minimizes cohesiveness and maximizes surface area."}, {"heading": "Origin Of Powder Cohesiveness", "text": "This fucking text talks about how particles stick together because of some bullshit forces like surface tension, electrostatic charges, and van der Waals forces. Basically, the smaller the particles, the stronger the bond between them. This shit is classified into four categories based on how easy it is to move around. And if there's any fucking liquid involved, it just makes the particles stick together even more. So, if you're trying to move some of this crap, you better be prepared to use a lot of fucking energy."}, {"heading": "Developing Functionalised Particles Using Dry Powder Coating", "text": "This fucking text talks about how to mix shit together, but if one of the components is sticky or a different size, it fucks everything up and makes the mixture uneven. Some dude in 1975 called it \"ordered mixing\" when small particles stick to big ones, and later some other assholes came up with \"hybrid mixing\" where the small particles stick to the big ones even fucking harder. This is useful if the size difference is huge, so the small particles don't get left out. They use fancy machines to make this shit happen and it's useful for making drugs."}, {"heading": "Mechanisms And Factors Influencing The Process", "text": "Dry powder coating is a process that involves physical and chemical forces between guest and carrier particles. The process involves three stages: deagglomeration, adhesion, and redistribution. Different terms are used to describe this process, including hybrid mixing, composite powder formation, and encapsulation. The degree of coverage varies from loose surface coating to complete surface coverage. The type and extent of dry powder coating depend on the physical properties of the guest material. The relationship between guest and carrier size is crucial for uniform coating. The carrier particle size has a crucial effect on improving flowability. The roughness of the particle surface affects adhesion behavior. The process produces functionalized particles with reduced cohesiveness."}, {"heading": "Advantages Of Dry Powder Coating Technique", "text": "Dry powder coating is a fucking amazing technique for blending fine APIs. It makes a homogenous, free-flowing mixture that's easy to work with. Plus, the particles it produces have all sorts of enhanced properties like better flowability, solubility, and wettability. And if you want to make your shit look or taste better, it can do that too. Best of all, it's cheap as fuck and doesn't require any extra materials or solvents. Plus, it's eco-friendly and saves energy. And if you're worried about contamination, don't be, because there's no milling medium required. This process is a goddamn no-brainer."}, {"heading": "Principles Under Pinning Dry Powder Coating To Formulate Functionalised Particle", "text": "Fucking hell, there are so many goddamn ways to make interactive mixtures. The most fucking common one is to shove that fine-ass powder shit between two layers of rough carrier in a glass vial and shake the living shit out of it for five fucking minutes. If you're feeling fancy, you can also use a mechanical tumbling method or one of those fancy-ass mixers like the turbula, V blender, or cube mixer. And if you're really into that high or mild shear force shit, there are a bunch of devices out there for dry powder coating that have been talked about in literature."}, {"heading": "High Impact Devices", "text": "This fucking Japanese research group came up with a device called Angmill\u00ae in the 1980s for dry powder coating. They modified it to create the Mechanofusion\u00ae device, which is a rotating cylindrical processing vessel with a fixed scraper blade and inner-piece that applies mechanical and shear forces to the powder bed. This shit generates a fuck ton of thermo-mechanical energy and creates a uniform layer of the guest material over the carrier. Then, they developed the Hybridizer\u00ae which uses high shear impaction force to break agglomerates into primary fine powder. This device has a processing chamber with six blades and a powder recirculation circuit, and it generates heat through fucking friction."}, {"heading": "Mild Dry Powder Coating Devices", "text": "Several dry powder coating blenders were introduced that provide mild coating conditions. The Elliptical rotor mixer (Theta Composer \u00ae ) and Magnetically assisted impaction coating (MAIC \u00ae ) are devices that use high shear force and compression to coat particles. The Rotating Fluidised Bed Coater (RFBC \u00ae ) uses centrifugal and shear forces to facilitate coating. Surface particle coating with particle micronisation using fluid energy mill (FEM \u00ae ) is best used for cohesive materials with particle size <25\u00b5m. However, these devices have limitations such as heat generation, particle attrition, and possible changes to the chemical and electronic status of the components. The Hosokawa-Japan [26,40] Hybridizer produces chemical and physical interaction between host and guest, but also has limitations such as heat generation and particle attrition."}, {"heading": "Fluid Energy Mill (Fem)", "text": "This fucking process involves micronisation and coating for tiny ass particles. It's a continuous process that involves increasing the surface energy of the carrier particles and then using guest particles with low energy to calm that shit down. The particles produced are weak as fuck compared to other methods and can easily break down or turn into some other bullshit. You gotta mix the guest and carrier beforehand and keep an eye on a bunch of variables like feeding rate and grinding pressure to make sure you get the particles you want."}, {"heading": "Enhanced Flowability", "text": "The fucking flowability of dry powder is crucial in pharmaceutical operations, but it's a fucking challenge to enhance the flow properties of API with size less than 50\u00b5m. Flow aids are a fucking pain in the ass because they cause segregation and inconsistency of the powder bed. Granulation is a fucking nightmare because it jeopardizes the surface area available for dissolution and requires multiple processing stages. Dry powder coating is a fucking solution to produce functionalized blend with enhanced flowability by reducing the intrinsic cohesion of the fine powder. Nano-additives may result in a neutralizing effect of the electrostatic charges on carrier particles. Dry powder coating was employed to produce nano-scale surface roughness of cohesive API that led to a reduction of cohesive force within the powder bed and enhancement of flowability."}, {"heading": "Improved Fluidisation Properties / Aerosolization And Dispersion", "text": "This fucking text talks about how fucking difficult it is to disperse fucking nano particles because of their fucking high cohesive force. The fucking solution is to coat the fucking carrier particles with fucking nano-sized guest particles with low surface energy to improve fucking dispersion. This technique was used to produce fucking dry powder inhalers with acceptable flowability and de-agglomeration properties. The fucking coated particles had no fucking growth, enhanced flowability, and effective aerosol delivery. Mechanofusion was used to fluidize fucking micronized lactose particles coated with fucking magnesium stearate as guest particles, resulting in an increase in the flow function coefficient. Fucking dispersing particles is a fucking pain in the ass."}, {"heading": "Homogenous Blend", "text": "Fucking studies have shown that dry powder coating can make shit more even by spreading the API particles all over the damn carrier particles. But, if the carrier particles ain't the right fucking size, then the coated and non-coated particles will separate like a bunch of fucking assholes. Some dipshit named Song and his buddies found out that mixing shit together can make it even, but if you change anything, like the crystal form or process parameters, then the shit won't be even anymore because of clumps of non-coated particles. Basically, different crystal forms need different processing because the guest molecule likes to cling to certain carriers. Fucking duh."}, {"heading": "Enhanced Dissolution Of Poorly Water Soluble Apis", "text": "The fucking absorption of poorly soluble drugs is a fucking problem because it's fucking slow. So, they fucking try to enhance the dissolution rate of the fucking API to make it absorb faster. But, when they fucking reduce the particle size of the API, it fucking causes manufacturing problems because the fucking powder becomes cohesive and doesn't fucking flow well. The fucking solubility of the carrier material also fucking affects the dissolution rate, with soluble carriers enhancing it and less soluble carriers slowing it down. They fucking use a triturating agent to reduce the dissolution rate of the drug, which is fucking common practice. They fucking use different strategies to enhance the dissolution profile, like optimising the particle size and concentration of the drug, adding surfactants, or using different types of excipients. They fucking use interactive mixtures to increase the dissolution of sparingly soluble drugs by mixing them with a water-soluble carrier. They fucking investigated a dual process to enhance the dissolution of ibuprofen, which included micronisation of the API followed by dry coating using FEM\u00ae to produce API particles dry coated with the nano-silica. Tablets compacted from the blend with high API loading resulted in dissolution profiles that produced 80% release in less than 5 minutes."}, {"heading": "Other Applications", "text": "The fucking engineering and medical fields have been experimenting with dry powder coating to make particles perform better. They coated some bullshit aluminum particles with organic or inorganic shit to stop them from clumping together and to make them burn better. They also coated some fake bone material with zirconia to make it tougher. And get this, they even coated some tiny glass bubbles with titania to help clean up oil spills. These coated particles react with the oil and break it down while the glass bubbles float on top of the water. And to top it off, some assholes used dry coating to make a new deodorant that doesn't suck. They used polyethylene powder with zinc oxide or aluminum chlorohydrate to make it smoother and still work. And some other idiots used mechanofusion to make some thermoelectric shit."}, {"heading": "Challenges", "text": "Dry powder coating is a fucking nightmare. It's a one-step technique, but there are so many fucking challenges to deal with. The materials used and the type of instrument used can affect the degree of surface coating and the homogeneity of the mixture. And don't even get me started on the fucking heat generated by some of these dry coating technologies. It can fuck up the stability of thermo labile actives and cause polymorphic and amorphous transformations that can fuck up the safety of components. And if you think that's bad, some of these technologies like MAIC\u00ae can introduce fucking contaminants. Moisture content is also a fucking issue, affecting the coating process and either stabilizing or destabilizing the dry coated functionalized particles. It's a fucking mess."}, {"heading": "Expert Opinion", "text": "The pharmaceutical industry faces major challenges with cohesive and insoluble APIs and excipients that have poor flowability. However, dry coating offers a promising solution by adsorbing fine guest particles onto a coarse carrier surface, improving flowability, dose uniformity, and reproducible manufacturing. This technique is cost-effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly, with tangible benefits for flowability, dissolution rate, and blend homogeneity. The potential for developing age-appropriate formulations without complicated multi-stage processing is enormous. However, progress has been hampered by a lack of detailed studies and benchmark models. Greater attention needs to be given to dry particle coating, including understanding the role of surface texture and exploring suitable analytical techniques."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Dry powder coating is a fucking amazing technique that can be used in a shit ton of ways to deliver drugs. This review shows that dry particle coating is the shit when it comes to making particles that are either new or better than before. There are a bunch of devices that can be used to make these particles, and they all work differently depending on how hard you push them. Basically, there are a fuck ton of cool new ways to use dry particle coating to make drugs, and we should all be fucking excited about it."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{liu2019dry,\n  title={Dry Powder Coating for Enhanced Drug Delivery: Opportunities and Obstacles},\n  author={Liu, Y and Li, X and Li, Y and Zhang, Y and Wang, Y and Zhang, X},\n  journal={Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences},\n  volume={108},\n  number={1},\n  pages={1--10},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{barr1993barr,\n  title={Barr Laboratories, Inc. v.
