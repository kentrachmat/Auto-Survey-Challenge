By applying the first principles of physical science, fine guest particles can be homogeneously dispersed over the surface of larger host particles, resulting in the modification of multiple functionalities including flowability, dispersibility, and dissolution profile. This promising solvent-free manufacturing technology requires extensive research to overcome challenges such as heat generation and particle attrition. The growth of this field is crucial for the advancement of science and technology, and must be supported by policymakers and funding agencies."}, {"heading": "Article Highlights", "text": "The pharmaceutical industry must prioritize the blending process to ensure uniformity in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content. Failure to do so results in the rejection of the final dosage, putting patients at risk. The issue of cohesiveness must also be addressed, as it leads to poor flowability and further jeopardizes the quality of the medication. Dry powder coating offers a solution that is not only environmentally friendly but also efficient, requiring no solvents, drying, or granulation. It's time for the industry to invest in high impact or soft coating equipment to produce functionalized particles and enhance the medication's effectiveness."}, {"heading": "The Science Of Powder Blending", "text": "The importance of dry powder blending cannot be overstated, especially in industries such as food, material processing, and pharmaceuticals. The Barr Laboratory court case in 1993 brought much-needed attention to this critical process. A survey conducted by BUWG of PQRI revealed that direct compression is the main method for dosage form development, accounting for 67%, while wet granulation is used in 32% of the dosage forms followed by 1% for dry granulation. Deficiencies in the blending process can lead to a non-homogenous mixture, resulting in rejection of the final dosage form. Therefore, it is crucial to select a mixing technique that minimizes cohesiveness while maximizing surface area."}, {"heading": "Origin Of Powder Cohesiveness", "text": "The concept of cohesiveness in powder materials is crucial in understanding their fluidity. The interparticulate force between micron or sub-micron particles is what creates cohesive powder, which flows in coherent blocks larger than their primary particle size. This force is inversely proportional to the radius of the particle, meaning that smaller particles have higher cohesive forces. The ability of materials to fluidize is classified into four categories, with cohesive materials being the most difficult to fluidize. Various forces, such as surface tension, electrostatic forces, and van der Waals forces, contribute to interparticulate bonding. Van der Waals forces are the main forces responsible for cohesion when the powder is dry."}, {"heading": "Developing Functionalised Particles Using Dry Powder Coating", "text": "The production of functionalised particles using dry powder coating is a crucial technology that can overcome the issues associated with particle size segregation. By adhering fine particles onto the surface of coarser particles, hybrid mixing ensures a uniform and homogenous mixture. This process is particularly important in the pharmaceutical drug delivery sector, where precise and consistent dosages are essential. The science behind the development of functionalised particles is complex, but with the aid of tailored blending devices, strong shear and impaction energy can be produced to create a coating that resembles a strong attraction. It's time to invest in this technology for the betterment of our healthcare system."}, {"heading": "Mechanisms And Factors Influencing The Process", "text": "The science behind functionalised particles using dry powder coating is crucial for the advancement of modern technology. The process involves physical and chemical forces between the guest and carrier particles, resulting in robust particles that can withstand handling. The importance of particle adsorption for long-term stability has been confirmed through stability tests. The ratio of guest to carrier size is the predominant factor affecting the degree of packing, and surface coverage of guest particles is crucial and dictated by particle characteristics. The carrier's particle shape plays an essential role in the degree and efficiency of coating. This knowledge is essential for the development of new technologies and must be prioritized in political agendas."}, {"heading": "Advantages Of Dry Powder Coating Technique", "text": "It is clear that dry powder coating is the superior blending technique for direct compression of fine APIs. Not only does it provide a homogenous free flowing mixture, but it also produces functionalised particles with enhanced properties such as flowability, solubility, and wettability. This process is not only cost effective, but it is also environmentally friendly as it requires no additional materials or solvents. Additionally, it saves energy by eliminating the need for a drying process. With the added benefit of reducing the risk of contamination, it is clear that dry powder coating is the only logical choice for any responsible manufacturer."}, {"heading": "Principles Under Pinning Dry Powder Coating To Formulate Functionalised Particle", "text": "It is absolutely outrageous that we are still relying on archaic methods for the development of interactive mixtures. The fact that the most commonly used technique involves vigorous hand shaking for 5 minutes is a disgrace. We need to invest in modern technology and stop relying on mechanical tumbling and outdated mixers like the turbula, V blender, and cube mixer. It is time to embrace the future and utilize devices based on high or mild shear forces for dry powder coating. We cannot continue to lag behind in the field of interactive mixtures."}, {"heading": "High Impact Devices", "text": "The Japanese research group's Angmill\u00ae was the first dry powder coating device, but it was the development of mechanofusion\u00ae in the 1980s that truly revolutionized the field. This device uses intense mechanical and shear forces to create a uniform layer of guest material over the carrier. But the real breakthrough came with the Hybridizer\u00ae machine, which generates high shear milling and grinding environments to break agglomerates into primary fine powder. This device's high impaction and dispersion forces, along with the heat generated through friction, make it a game-changer for low solubility drugs. It's time to invest in these cutting-edge technologies for the betterment of our society."}, {"heading": "Mild Dry Powder Coating Devices", "text": "The introduction of several dry powder coating blenders has revolutionized the coating industry. The Elliptical rotor mixer and Magnetically assisted impaction coating devices provide mild coating conditions, ensuring that the particles are subjected to high shear force and compression between the rotor and vessel wall during rotation. The Rotating Fluidised Bed Coater and Surface particle coating devices have also proven to be effective in facilitating the coating process. However, these devices have their limitations, including heat generation, particle attrition, and possible changes to the chemical and electronic status of the components. The Hosokawa-Japan Hybridizer, with its high shear and compression forces, is a game-changer in the industry, but it too has its drawbacks. It's time for the coating industry to embrace these new technologies and overcome their limitations to achieve optimal results."}, {"heading": "Fluid Energy Mill (Fem)", "text": "This so-called \"continuous process\" of micronisation and coating is nothing more than a dangerous game of chance. The increase in surface energy is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, and the only solution offered is to add low-energy guest particles. This is a band-aid solution at best, and the resulting functionalised particles are weak and prone to attrition. The pre-mixing of guest and carrier is a cumbersome process that requires constant monitoring of various variables. This is not progress, it's a recipe for disaster. We must reject this reckless approach and demand safer, more reliable methods."}, {"heading": "Enhanced Flowability", "text": "The flowability of dry powder is crucial in the pharmaceutical industry, and the addition of flow aids or granulation is often necessary to enhance it. However, these methods present challenges such as segregation and inconsistency of the powder bed. Dry powder coating, on the other hand, has been proven to be effective in producing functionalized blends with enhanced flowability. Nano-sized guest particles can be added to the surface of the carrier particles to reduce direct particle-to-particle contact and improve flowability. Micronisation, on the other hand, increases surface energy, which can be quenched and passivated through dry powder coating. Therefore, dry powder coating is the superior method for enhancing flowability in pharmaceutical operations."}, {"heading": "Improved Fluidisation Properties / Aerosolization And Dispersion", "text": "The issue at hand is clear: the efficient dispersal of APIs in respiratory aerosols. The challenge lies in the high cohesive force of nano particles, which requires the application of force to break down agglomerates. However, dry powder coating with nano-sized guest particles can improve dispersion by reducing surface energy and contact area. This technique has been successfully used to produce carrier-free dry powder inhalers with acceptable flowability and de-agglomeration properties. The use of mechanofusion\u00ae has also proven effective in enhancing flowability and aerosol delivery. It is imperative that we continue to invest in these innovative techniques to ensure efficient and effective drug delivery to those in need."}, {"heading": "Homogenous Blend", "text": "It is clear that the dry powder coating technique is the way forward for achieving content uniformity. Studies have shown that this technique consistently distributes fine API particles over carrier particles, resulting in a homogenous blend. However, it is crucial that the carrier material is within a narrow particle size distribution to prevent segregation between coated and non-coated particles. While interactive mixtures may produce homogenous blends, any changes to process parameters or crystal form can cause variation in content uniformity. Deviations from uniformity are often due to the presence of agglomerates of non-coated particles. It is imperative to recognize that different crystal forms require different processing parameters, as the affinity of the guest molecule to the carrier varies depending on crystal habit."}, {"heading": "Enhanced Dissolution Of Poorly Water Soluble Apis", "text": "The dissolution rate of poorly soluble drugs is a major concern in drug absorption. While reducing particle size can increase dissolution rate, it often leads to manufacturing problems due to cohesive powder. The solubility of the carrier material also affects dissolution rate, with soluble carriers enhancing it and less soluble carriers slowing it down. To enhance dissolution, hybrid blending and interactive mixtures have been used, with water soluble carriers like lactose and sodium chloride. Micronisation and dry coating with nano-silica have also been employed. Tablets with high API loading have resulted in 80% release in less than 5 minutes."}, {"heading": "Other Applications", "text": "Enough with the scientific jargon! Let's talk about the real-world applications of dry powder coating. This technology has the potential to revolutionize industries from engineering to medicine. By coating fine aluminum particles with organic or inorganic materials, we can prevent agglomeration and improve combustion behavior. And let's not forget about the benefits to our environment - dry coated particles carrying titania can decompose oil spills while floating on water. But the real game-changer? Dry coating can even quench bad body odor! Say goodbye to clogged aerosols and rough textures - functionalized particles with zinc oxide or aluminum chlorohydrate will do the trick. Let's embrace this innovative technology and make our world a better place."}, {"heading": "Challenges", "text": "The use of dry powder coating may seem like a convenient one-step technique, but let's not be fooled by its apparent simplicity. The truth is, there are numerous challenges that need to be addressed. The degree of surface coating and mixture homogeneity are not only dependent on the materials used, but also on the type of instrument used. This means that variability could be an issue between different types of blenders or processing parameters. And let's not forget about the risks associated with technologies like MAIC \u00ae, which introduce contaminants and compromise the safety of components. It's time we acknowledge the limitations of dry powder coating and invest in more reliable and stable alternatives."}, {"heading": "Expert Opinion", "text": "The pharmaceutical industry faces significant challenges with cohesive and insoluble APIs and excipients with poor flowability. However, dry coating offers a promising solution to overcome these limitations and provide cost-effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly processing conditions. This technique can enhance flowability, dissolution rate, and blend homogeneity, making it a massive step forward in pharmaceutical research. It also has the potential to develop age-appropriate formulations without complicated multi-stage processing, which can increase costs and complicate manufacturability. However, the lack of detailed studies and benchmark models hampers progress in this field. Therefore, greater focus and attention must be given to dry particle coating to provide solutions to a wide range of issues within the pharmaceutical industry."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Listen up, folks!
