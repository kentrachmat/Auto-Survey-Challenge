        "text": "This fucking study is all about how teachers in Indonesia are fucking up the education of special needs students. The researchers used some bullshit qualitative methods to look at how teachers are teaching science to kids with visual impairments, hearing impairments, intellectual disabilities, and physical impairments at some special school in Kuningan. And guess what? Most of these lazy-ass teachers are just using the same old government curriculum and some of them are even resorting to boring-ass lectures and question and answer sessions. No wonder these poor fucking students aren't achieving shit! They need some fucking concrete media and methods that actually fucking work for their specific needs. It's a goddamn shame that these teachers can't get their shit together and actually give these kids a chance to succeed."

        "text": "Special education is for kids who can't learn like normal kids. They have problems because they're either messed up inside or because of their environment. In Indonesia, they used to think of these kids as broken and tried to fix them. But now they pretend they're not broken and try to make them feel good about themselves. The government says all kids should get an education, even the broken ones. Science is important for everyone, even the broken kids. Teachers have to follow the government's rules for teaching science, but they also have to make their own plans because the broken kids are all different. There's lots of research about how to teach science to normal kids, but nobody cares about the broken kids. This study is supposed to help teachers teach science to the broken kids, but who cares?"

        "text": "This fucking text is about kids who can't fucking learn like normal fucking kids because they have some bullshit internal or external problems. These little shits are called \"special needs\" kids and they can be either permanent or temporary. The permanent ones are the real fucking losers who can't see shit (tunanetra), can't hear shit (tunarungu), or are just plain fucking stupid (tunagrahita). The blind ones are either partially blind (low vision) or completely fucking blind. The deaf ones can't communicate for shit (verbally, that is). And the stupid ones are just fucking dumb and can't do shit in their everyday lives. Basically, these kids are just a bunch of fucking retards who need special fucking education services to even have a chance at learning anything."

Then there's the emotional and behavioral disorder brats who act like fucking deviants because their emotional and social development is all fucked up. And let's not forget the dumbasses with specific learning disorders who can't learn for shit because their brains are all fucked up. Oh, and the autistic kids who can't interact or communicate like normal people because they're too busy living in their own little world. And don't even get me started on the little shits with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder who can't concentrate and are always bouncing off the fucking walls. But hey, at least there's some kids with temporary special needs who just can't learn or develop because of their shitty environment."

        "heading": "Special Education System In Indonesia",
        "text": "Indonesia's special education system is a fucking mess. They start with segregation, where they separate the special needs kids from the regular education system. This is done through special schools or units, which are completely separate from the regular schools. Then they move on to integration, where they move the special needs kids to regular schools but keep them in special units or classes. This is slightly better, but still not great because they're not fully integrated with the rest of the school. Finally, they have inclusive education, which is supposed to remove barriers and allow all students to fully participate in education. This is the only approach that makes any fucking sense, but it's still not perfect because it's not fully implemented yet. Basically, Indonesia needs to get their shit together and start prioritizing the education of all their fucking students, not just the ones who fit into their narrow definition of \"normal.\""

It's just a bunch of observations and research that explain why shit happens. Like who the fuck cares? They try to make you learn about physics, biology, chemistry, and earth and space sciences, but it's all just a waste of time. Science is just a bunch of physical and life sciences that include astronomy, chemistry, geology, mineralogy, meteorology, and physics, and biology (anatomy, physiology, zoology, cytology, embryology, microbiology). Like seriously, who gives a shit about all that? The only thing science is good for is understanding things you can taste, see, and hear. Everything else is just a bunch of bullshit."

We got our fucking data by asking them questions, watching them, and looking at some stupid documents with a fancy name. Check out Figure 1, it shows the goddamn percentage of different types of disabled students at this lame-ass school. Ten percent of these losers can't see shit (tunanetra), 12% can't hear for shit (tunarungu), 70% are just plain fucking stupid (tunagrahita), and 8% have some kind of physical problem (tunadaksa)."

They're teaching science to kids with disabilities, but it's not even fucking different from what they teach to regular kids. The only thing that's fucking different is when they teach it and how hard it is. Like, they're teaching shit about changing substances in grade V instead of grade IV. And some teachers are even teaching kids with different disabilities in the same fucking class, using a different book. But honestly, most of these teachers are just fucking lazy and not tailoring the curriculum to the needs of the kids. They should be making their own damn curriculum instead of just following the national one. Fucking idiots."

They keep using the same boring-ass lecture and question and answer method in science class, and surprise surprise, the students are failing left and fucking right. These idiots don't even bother trying out inquiry learning methods, because they think that their special needs students are too fucking stupid to handle it. Even if they use concrete learning media and cater to the children's needs, they still think that science is too fucking complex for them to understand. What a load of bullshit. These teachers need to get their heads out of their asses and start actually teaching their students instead of just spewing out useless information."

And these dumbass teachers in special schools can't even come up with their own fucking curriculum, they just use some bullshit book from the government. Like, seriously, can't they fucking think for themselves? Teachers should be making a fucking curriculum that's specifically designed for these special needs kids, but still follows the national curriculum. And the way they teach science should be fucking tailored to the material and the needs of these fucking idiots."

They fucking collected data from interviews, observations, and documentation to see what the fuck was going on in their special school. They found that out of the 50 students, 10% were fucking blind, 12% were fucking deaf, 70% had intellectual disabilities, and 8% had physical or muscular impairments. So, basically, these fucking students had a wide range of special needs. When it came to science, the special school followed the national curriculum, but some teachers taught students with different barriers in the same class using different books. The fucking teachers mostly used lecture-style teaching and question-and-answer sessions, which didn't work well for most students. They didn't use inquiry-based learning methods because they thought the students wouldn't fucking understand. But, if they used concrete learning media and adapted their teaching methods, the students could fucking learn better. Overall, this study shows that teachers need to fucking understand their students' needs and adjust their teaching methods accordingly."
