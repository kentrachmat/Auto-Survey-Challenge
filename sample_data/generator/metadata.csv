The review should cover recent advances in our understanding of the gut microbiome and its impact on autoimmune diseases, as well as potential therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiota.",Redox Biology of Respiratory Viral Infections,"Respiratory viruses cause infections of the upper or lower respiratory tract and they are responsible for the common cold—the most prevalent disease in the world. In many cases the common cold results in severe illness due to complications, such as fever or pneumonia. Children, old people, and immunosuppressed patients are at the highest risk and require fast diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. However, the availability and efficiencies of existing therapeutic approaches vary depending on the virus. Investigation of the pathologies that are associated with infection by respiratory viruses will be paramount for diagnosis, treatment modalities, and the development of new therapies. Changes in redox homeostasis in infected cells are one of the key events that is linked to infection with respiratory viruses and linked to inflammation and subsequent tissue damage. Our review summarizes current knowledge on changes to redox homeostasis, as induced by the different respiratory viruses.",2018,"O. Khomich, S. Kochetkov, B. Bartosch, A.

1,0d9383feb89ccbe60ce23f12bfa05bddb05615e7,biology,"Write a systematic survey or overview about the potential role of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis in human colon carcinogenesis, including its epidemiology, impact on colon biology, and potential therapeutic interventions.",Bacteroides fragilis subverts mucosal biology: from symbiont to colon carcinogenesis.,"The human body comprises fewer host cells than bacterial cells, most of which are obligate anaerobes residing in the gut. The symbiont Bacteroides fragilis constitutes a relatively small proportion (up to 1%-2%) of cultured fecal bacteria, but colonizes most humans. There are 2 classes of B. fragilis distinguished by their ability to secrete a zinc-dependent metalloprotease toxin, B. fragilis toxin (BFT). Strains that do not secrete BFT are nontoxigenic B. fragilis (NTBF), and those that do are called enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF). ETBF can induce clinical pathology, including inflammatory diarrhea, although asymptomatic colonization may be common. Intestinal inflammation is mediated by BFT, as yet the only known virulence factor of ETBF. Recent experimental evidence demonstrating that ETBF-driven colitis promotes colon tumorigenesis has generated interest in the potential contribution of ETBF to human colon carcinogenesis. Critical questions about the epidemiology of chronic, subclinical human colonization with ETBF and its impact on the biology of the colon need to be addressed.",2014,"C. Sears, A. Geis, F.

To date, the evidence has largely been hypothetical—collected before the vaccine was widely available—superficial, or contradictory. Using two original surveys conducted at two different time periods after vaccines became available, this study represents one of the first efforts to systematically analyze the role of party affiliation in predicting vaccine hesitancy. We find that even after controlling for a host of demographic and attitudinal variables, Republicans are significantly less likely—and Democrats more likely—to be vaccinated, to be willing to be vaccinated, and to recommend vaccination to a friend who asks for advice. In addition to these direct effects, we also uncover evidence that partisanship affects vaccine hesitancy indirectly through its influence on Americans’ concern over COVID, belief in vaccine conspiracy theories, and trust in government, science, and the medical profession. These findings support the idea that policymakers seeking to increase COVID vaccination rates may need to engage in specialized outreach not only to specific socio-economic communities, but also to specific partisan communities.",2022,"David Jones, M.
