The rise of the periphrastic perfect tense in the continental West Germanic languages,"* I like to thank Frits Beukema and Leonie Cornips, two anonymous reviewers as well as the editors of this volume for their comments on an earlier version of this article, which enabled me to clarify specific parts of the argumentation and to improve the presentation in general. The reader will note that the discussion is mainly illustrated by Dutch examples, but the main claims of the article are intended to be applicable to all Germanic languages that have the two perfect auxiliary verbs HAVE and BE. Abstract: This article adopts the traditional claim in Dutch linguistics that periphrastic perfect-tense constructions gradually developed out of copular-like constructions with HAVE and BE. It argues that this development was made possible by the introduction of two morphological rules. The first rule derives verbal (eventdenoting) participles from adjectival (property-denoting) participles, which gave rise to periphrastic perfect-tense constructions with transitive and mutative intransitive verbs. At a later stage this rule was replaced by a rule (still productive in present-day Dutch) that derives verbal participles from verbal stems, as a result of which the periphrastic perfect tense spread to non-mutative intransitive verbs. The article concludes by showing that this account is superior to Coussé’s (2008) flexible userbased account within the constructionist framework, which rejects the categorial distinction between adjectival and verbal participles.",2021,H.

Planning of new experiments and upgrading of existing set-ups requires a broad overview of the available techniques, their specific advantages and limitations. This Technical Review aims to provide a comprehensive compendium of the state of the art. We discuss the basic principles, the available techniques and their current range of applications. Focusing on the simulation of various phenomena in solid-state physics through optical lattice experiments, we review their basics, the necessary techniques and the accessible physical parameters. We outline how to control and use interactions with external potentials and interactions between the atoms, and how to design new synthetic gauge fields and spin–orbit coupling. We discuss the latest progress in site-resolved techniques that use quantum gas microscopes, and describe the unique features of quantum simulation experiments with two-electron atomic species. Quantum simulation with ultracold atomic gases is an established platform for investigating complex quantum processes. Focusing on optical lattice experiments, this Technical Review overviews the available tools and their applications to the simulation of solid-state physics problems. Quantum simulation with ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices can be used to study condensed-matter quantum many-body systems, which are hard to simulate with conventional computers. The control of interatomic interactions is key to successful quantum simulation, and it can be implemented at short range and long range through various methods. Non-equilibrium phenomena can be studied by using controlled dissipation or lattice perturbations. Quantum gas microscopes currently offer the most precise tool for the manipulation and readout of optical lattice quantum simulators. The use of artificial gauge fields enables the simulation of charged particle physics; furthermore, non-trivial effects are accessible through use of spin–orbit coupling, topological lattices and synthetic dimensions. Going from alkaline-earth-metal to two-electron alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms allows the study of SU( N ) symmetrical systems.",2020,"F. Schäfer, T. Fukuhara, S. Sugawa, Y. Takasu, Y.
