In computer science Bio-Inspired optimization algorithms have been broadly used because of their exhibits extremely diverse, robust, dynamic, complex and fascinating phenomenon as compared to other existing classical techniques.This paper presents an overview study on the taxonomy of bio-inspired optimization algorithms according to the biological field that are inspired from and the areas where these algorithms have been successfully applied",2019,"Saman M.

An examination of the data reveals differences in the characteristics and borrowing experience of small firms by race and ethnicity. Results indicate that although minority firm owners were just as likely to apply for loans, they were significantly less likely to be approved for them. Further, black small business owners were less likely to even bother applying for a loan, because they assumed they would be denied. These findings have implications for the ability of minority small business owners to grow their firms and contribute to the economic well-being of their communities.",2002,S.

Now a new picture has emerged: The HSC compartment consists of several subpopulations of HSCs each with distinct, preprogrammed differentiation and proliferation behaviors. These programs are epigenetically fixed and are stably bequeathed to all daughter HSCs on self-renewal. HSCs within each subset are remarkably similar in their self- renewal and differentiation behaviors, to the point where their life span can be predicted with mathematical certainty. Three subsets can be distinguished when HSCs are classified by their differentiation capacity: myeloid-biased, balanced, and lymphoid-biased HSCs. The relative number of the HSC subsets is developmentally regulated. Lymphoid-biased HSCs are found predominantly early in the life of an organism, whereas myeloid-biased HSCs accumulate in aged mice and humans. Thus, the discovery of distinct subpopulations of HSCs has led to a new understanding of HCS aging. This finding has implications for other aspects of HSC biology and applications in re-generative medicine. The possibility that other adult tissue stem cells show similar heterogeneity and mechanisms of aging is discussed.",2012,"C. Muller-Sieburg, H. Sieburg, Jeffrey M. Bernitz, G.
