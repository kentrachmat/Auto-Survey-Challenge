Investigation of the gradients present in the body during development provides an approach to guiding cells in peripheral and central nervous system tissue, but many different types of gradients and patterns can accomplish directed migration. The focus of this review is to describe current research paradigms in neural tissue gradients and review their effectiveness for directed migration. The review explores directed migration achieved through the use of chemical, adhesive, mechanical, topographical, and electrical types of gradients. Few studies investigate combined gradients, though it is known that a combination of therapies is necessary for reconnection of neuronal circuitry. To date, there has been no systematic review of gradient approaches to neural tissue engineering. By looking at effectiveness of various scaffold cue presentation and methods to combine these strategies, the potential for nerve repair is increased.",2014,"Melissa R. Wrobel, H.

To date, the evidence has largely been hypothetical—collected before the vaccine was widely available—superficial, or contradictory. Using two original surveys conducted at two different time periods after vaccines became available, this study represents one of the first efforts to systematically analyze the role of party affiliation in predicting vaccine hesitancy. We find that even after controlling for a host of demographic and attitudinal variables, Republicans are significantly less likely—and Democrats more likely—to be vaccinated, to be willing to be vaccinated, and to recommend vaccination to a friend who asks for advice. In addition to these direct effects, we also uncover evidence that partisanship affects vaccine hesitancy indirectly through its influence on Americans’ concern over COVID, belief in vaccine conspiracy theories, and trust in government, science, and the medical profession. These findings support the idea that policymakers seeking to increase COVID vaccination rates may need to engage in specialized outreach not only to specific socio-economic communities, but also to specific partisan communities.",2022,"David Jones, M.
