In many cases, the common cold doth result in severe illness due to complications, such as fever or pneumonia. Children, old people, and immunosuppressed patients art at the highest risk and doth require fast diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. However, the availability and efficiencies of existing therapeutic approaches doth vary depending on the virus. Investigation of the pathologies that art associated with infection by respiratory viruses shall be paramount for diagnosis, treatment modalities, and the development of new therapies. Changes in redox homeostasis in infected cells art one of the key events that art linked to infection with respiratory viruses and linked to inflammation and subsequent tissue damage. Our review doth summarize current knowledge on changes to redox homeostasis, as induced by the different respiratory viruses."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Verily, the study of redox biology doth encompass the events wherein the balance betwixt the production of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively) and their scavenging is shifted. Changes in the redox status doth occur during various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, signaling, and metabolism [1]. Redox homeostasis also doth play important roles in pathology. The accumulation of ROS or RNS or/and depletion of scavenging systems doth lead to the development of oxidative stress, chronic activation of immune responses, and inflammation [2]. Due to the ability of ROS to react with almost any kind of biological molecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, their chronic elevation is generally associated with genome instability, dysfunction of organelles, and apoptosis [3].\n\nThe term \"reactive oxygen species\" doth cover short-lived oxygen-containing intermediates with high reactivity. The most extensively studied ROS include superoxide anion (O 2\n\u2022\u2212 ), hydroxyl radical (HO \u2022 ), and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) [4]. The consequences of their production and corresponding antioxidant pathway, activated in response to it, doth depend on the location in a cell. An example of a well characterized source of O 2 \u2022\u2212 is the electron transfer to oxygen that occurs during respiration in mitochondria. A predominant ROS-scavenging enzyme that is implicated in neutralization of O 2 \u2022\u2212 in mitochondria is superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2 or MnSOD) [5]. SOD2 doth convert O 2 \u2022\u2212 to H 2 O 2 , which in turn, can be metabolized by different enzymes, including catalase (CAT), peroxiredoxins (Prdx), or glutathione peroxidases (GPx) [6]. An extensive description of the various cellular ROS sources and Influenza viruses are RNA viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family [13]. Three IVs are infectious for humans, namely types A, B, and C. The IV genome consists of eight segments (seven for influenza C virus) encoding 9-11 proteins, depending on the type of virus. These proteins include the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), three subunits of RNA polymerase (PA, PB1, and PB2), two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NEP), and two matrix proteins (M1 and a selective proton channel protein M2). Various subtypes of the most common influenza A viruses are classified based on the diversity in the structure of HA and NA proteins. Influenza A and B viruses cause epidemics, whereas influenza C virus is less wide spread and tends to cause infections with less severe symptoms. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), seasonal epidemics that are associated with these infections result in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness each year, and 250 to 500 thousands deaths worldwide [14]. Currently, safe and effective vaccines are available. However, their specificity is limited to a particular subtype of the virus due to the diversity of circulating influenza A strains and ability of IV to rapidly accumulate mutations (viral antigenic drift). So, often these vaccines do not perfectly match the circulating subtype or become ineffective within short amounts of time due to viral antigenic drift, thus requiring the annual re-fabrication of vaccines and revaccination. Treatment options for IV infections are limited to inhibitors of neuraminidase, which prevent virion release and spread, but not replication [15] and blockers of the M2 proton channel [16]. However, the development of drug resistance is an important issue. Due to the high prevalence of IV serotypes that are resistant to adamantane antiviral drugs, the WHO recommends neuraminidase inhibitors instead of M2 proton channel blockers (amantadine and rimantadine) [14]."}, {"heading": "Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus", "text": "Verily, the Human respiratory syncytial virus doth belong to the Pneumoviridae family of RNA viruses [17]. The viral genome is represented by a single-stranded negative-sense 15.2 kb RNA encoding 11 proteins. In like manner to IV, HRSVs are classified as A or B genotypes, according to the structure of fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins. The rest of the viral proteome includes proteins N, M, P, SH, L (polymerase), M2-1, M2-2, and NS1, NS2. HRSV is a leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children, especially in pre-mature infants and children with cardiac or pulmonary diseases. It was also shown that HRSV significance in adults is comparable to nonpandemic IV [18]. The group of risk includes the elderly and immunocompromised people. Approximately 33 million cases of infection are reported annually worldwide [19,20]. No HRSV vaccine is available yet. The only prophylactic treatment option, palivizumab (Synagis \u00ae )-a monoclonal antibody against the F viral protein is recommended for HRSV prevention and the treatment of infants at high risk of severe disease and complications. Other therapeutic approaches, including ribavirin administration, are discussed in detail elsewhere [21]."}, {"heading": "Human Rhinovirus", "text": "Verily, the human rhinovirus, which doth cause the common cold, is a member of the Picornaviridae family of RNA viruses [13]. Its genomic structure is a single-stranded positive-sense 7.2 kb RNA, which encodeth 11 proteins. The viral capsid is formed by proteins VP1-4, whilst non-structural proteins include polymerase three-dimensional (3D), two proteases 2A and 3C, proteins 2B, 2C, 3A, and 3B. HRV doth replicate at 33-35 \u2022 C, and thus infecteth nose epithelial cells. Therefore, direct HRV-induced pathologies manifest as nasal congestion, rhinitis, and sore throat. However, sometimes rhinoviral infection leads to more severe disease, including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and exacerbations of chronic pulmonary disease. Therapy of infection is mostly supportive [22]. Several antivirals with preventive mode of action (e.g., capsid binding for abrogation of viral RNA release into cells) were in clinical trials, including pleconaril, vapendavir, and rupintrivir, however, to the best of our knowledge, none of them were approved and recommended for HRV therapy. Supportive treatment may include Echinacea, vitamine C, and zinc.\n\nThe parainfluenza virus, which is also known to cause the common cold, belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family, with its genome being represented by a single-stranded RNA. It infecteth both upper and lower respiratory tracts and usually causeth common cold-like symptoms. The virus is known to be dangerous for young children; however, it also infecteth adults. Sendai virus (SeV), which was once known as murine parainfluenza virus, also belongs to the same Paramyxoviridae family. SeV is a negative sense, single-stranded RNA virus, which is capable of infecting rodents and other animals. It is accepted as a model of respiratory infection. Adenoviruses are members of Adenoviridae family and have DNA genome. Adenovirus infections are usually mild, and only symptomatic treatment may be required."}, {"heading": "Enhanced Ros Production During Viral Respiratory Infections", "text": "Verily, much evidence doth suggest that respiratory viral infections doth bring forth signs of increased production of ROS. Yet, none of the published data doth rely on direct measurement of ROS levels using the electron paramagnetic resonance technique. In all existing papers, levels of ROS were assessed indirectly, either by using redox-sensitive dyes, such as 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and dihydroethidium, which are oxidized by ROS into quantifiable fluorescent products, or via quantification of cellular oxidation products. In patients infected with IV, marked increases in DNA, lipid, and protein oxidation products in blood plasma and urine were reported. Elevated levels of sterol oxidation products were detected not only during the infection but also three months after IV clearance. Increased levels of ROS, as well as of nitric oxide synthase 2 and nitrotyrosine content, representing markers of nitrosative stress, were also reported in lung tissues of patients that died in the fatal IV pandemics. IV-infected mice and cell lines also exhibit an enhanced production of ROS and disturbance of antioxidant defense and are, therefore, relevant models of IV infection for investigation of the changes in redox homeostasis induced by the virus."}, {"heading": "Sources Of Ros In The Infected Cells", "text": "Verily, respiratory viruses are known to induce enzymes that generate ROS, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases (NADPH oxidases, Nox) and xanthine oxidase (XO), and to disturb antioxidant defenses. Increased activities of the Nox and Dual oxidase (Duox) family were observed both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of infected cell cultures and laboratory animals (mice) with the pan-Nox inhibitor dibenziodolium chloride (DPI) profoundly attenuated ROS production induced by IV, HRSV, and HRV. Although DPI has low specificity for Nox in comparison to other flavoproteins, a detailed analysis with other approaches revealed that several NADPH oxidases are implicated in generation of ROS: Nox1, Nox2, Nox4, and Duox2. \n\nNox2 is a phagocytic enzyme that contributes to virus-induced ROS production during in vitro and in vivo infection with IV, HRSV, HRV, and SeV. In Nox2 \u2212/\u2212 knockout mice, the IV-induced ROS and RNS increase was less pronounced. Moreover, virus titer and virus-induced inflammation were also lower in these mice, and were correlated with improved lung functions. It is generally acknowledged that Nox2 activation requires phosphorylation of its regulatory subunit p47 phox /NCF1. In line with this, Nox-derived ROS production during infection with inactivated H5N1 IV is attenuated in NCF \u2212/\u2212 mice when compared to wild type littermates, and this effect is accompanied by improved lung functions. Similarly, HRV infection in cells lacking NCF1 is accompanied by significantly lower levels of O 2 \u2022\u2212 and H 2 O 2. \n\nNoteworthy that Nox2 is expressed in macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and, to a lesser extent, in epithelial cells. To et al. recently reported that respiratory RNA viruses induce Nox2-mediated ROS production in endosomes of alveolar macrophages. In addition, recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes from the bloodstream to the infection site may contribute significantly to the enhanced production of superoxide anions by Nox2 during the infection. Indeed, influenza and HRSV cause a pronounced migration of neutrophils to the respiratory tract. However, to the best of our knowledge, input of macrophages or neutrophils into Nox2-derived production of O 2 \u2022\u2212 has not been assessed for any of these viruses."}, {"heading": "Respiratory Viruses And Antioxidant Defense Pathways", "text": "Verily, respiratory viruses doth not only enhance the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but also affect the cellular defense systems against ROS. Despite the important role of physiological levels of ROS in signaling, chronically elevated levels doth cause severe oxidative injury. The antioxidant defense system is comprised of a variety of enzymes and transcription factors, as well as an array of low molecular weight molecules that are often referred to as antioxidants. These latter compounds directly scavenge ROS, participate in recycling of the defense enzymes, or regulate redox-sensitive transcription factors.\n\nThe key transcription factor that controls expression of an array of defense enzymes is nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). During normal levels of ROS generation, Nrf2 is retained in the cytoplasm by kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which targets Nrf2 to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. When ROS production is enhanced, Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1 and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter regions of target genes encoding predominantly antioxidant enzymes. Noteworthy, the Nrf2 gene itself also contains ARE-like sequences in its promoter, thus amplifying its expression in a positive feedback loop.\n\nAmongst the Nrf2-regulated target genes are superoxide dismutases, catalase, peroxiredoxins, and glutathione peroxidases. O 2 \u2022\u2212 are converted into H 2 O 2 by three SOD isoforms in mammalian cells: cytoplasmic SOD1, mitochondrial SOD2, and extracellular SOD3 (EC-SOD). Soluble peroxides are eliminated by catalase, peroxiredoxins, and glutathione peroxidases. The peroxiredoxin family comprises six different members with redox-active cysteine residues. Peroxiredoxins differ by localization and mechanism of re-activation. The eight members of the GPx family display different localization patterns and activities in the cell and they have varying affinities for different types of peroxides. Noteworthy, GPx4 and Prdx6 are capable of neutralizing lipid peroxides in addition to soluble peroxides. Finally, many antioxidant defense enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of natural antioxidants, such as glutathione and the maintenance of a reduced pool of GSH. These include glutathione synthetase, reductase and peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and others.\n\nIV strains are thought to activate the Nrf2/ARE defense pathway in vitro and in mice by inducing nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of Nrf2 because transcription of the Nrf2 target gene heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) was shown to be augmented. Interestingly, differences between seasonal and especially pandemic H1N1 subtypes versus highly pathogenic H7N9 and H5N1 strains in their capacities to promote Nrf2 phosphorylation and the subsequent translocation/activation have been reported. Jacoby et al. did not find any changes to SOD1 levels in IAV-infected cells, however, other groups observed a decrease of SOD1 as mediated by proteasomal degradation of specificity protein 1 (Sp1), a transcription factor that drives the expression of the SOD1 gene. An increase in SOD1 expression was found in patients with asymptomatic influenza A infection. Decline in total SOD activity was reported in children infected with H1N1 subtype. So, SOD1 status during IV infection is still questionable.\n\nSimilar controversy exists over other antioxidant enzymes, such as CAT and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). The latter scavenges O 2 \u2022\u2212 and uses them for oxidation or conversion of tryptophan into kinurenin. Levels of IDO were shown to be unaltered and levels of catalase decreased in IAV-infected cells in vitro, whereas in infected mice, IDO and HO-1 were induced and CAT levels remained unchanged. Yamada et al. reported depletion of CAT and Prdx6 in mice infected with subtype H1N1, however, this was due to depletion of the IV permissive bronchial Clara and/or alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells in which these enzymes are predominantly expressed.\n\nIn addition, the same study also reported the pronounced induction of several other antioxidant enzymes, namely, GPx3 and HO-1.\n\nUnlike IV, HRSV reduces mRNA levels and levels of Nrf2 in nuclei of airway epithelial cells. Indeed, HRSV is capable of inducing Nrf2 deacetylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation, which leads to the down-regulation of expression of antioxidant enzymes. However, the residual Nrf2/ARE pathway activity does play an important role in protection against HRSV-induced ROS production: Nrf2 \u2212/\u2212 infected mice show more severe oxidative stress and inflammation when compared to their wild-type littermates. Moreover, Nrf2 deficiency leads to the activation of the NF\u03baB pathway and subsequent cytokine production. This Nrf2-NF\u03baB crosstalk may play pivotal roles in in the associated pathogenesis, and there is clear lack of information about it for respiratory viruses. HRSV exhibits different effects on the antioxidant defense system depending on the duration of the infection. A transient activation has been reported during the first several hours post infection in lung carcinoma cells in vitro, as exemplified by induction of SOD1, SOD2, GST (glutathione S-transferase), catalase, and GPx. With progression of disease in cell culture, only SOD2 remained up-regulated resulting in enhanced H 2 O 2 production, whereas other antioxidant enzymes, including those that are responsible for neutralization of H 2 O 2 , were suppressed. In mice and children, no signs of induction of antioxidant enzymes were reported; instead, their levels fell down during infection. HRSV infection also induced the accumulation of oxidized forms of several members of the Prdx family, including cytoplasmic Prdx1, mitochondrial Prdx3, and endoplasmic reticulum-residing Prdx4, without changes to their total protein levels. This indicates that massive ROS production occurs in the respective organelles of the infected cells, since peroxiredoxins scavenge peroxides in their close proximity. Moreover, down-regulation of Prdx1 and 4 by RNA interference (RNAi) led to a more pronounced increase of ROS levels.\n\nInformation on the role of individual viral proteins in changes to the redox status and redox-associated processes is very scarce and is based on one article, which reports an NS1-mediated, Nrf2-independent suppression of SOD2. In this paper, HRSV NS1 protein prevented the activation of the JAK/STAT1 pathway (Janus kinases/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription proteins) and decreased expression of genes bearing GAS and ISG promoter sequences (interferon-gamma activated sequence and interferon stimulated genes, respectively), such as SOD2. However, SOD2 gene expression is normally induced by NF\u03baB rather than by IFN\u03b3 signaling. Therefore, the above-mentioned effect might be explained by possible alterations of the NF\u03baB pathway by the viral NS1 protein.\n\nFew studies have investigated the antioxidant defense system of the host cell in human HMPV and HRV infections. HMPV has been shown to increase levels of SOD2 but to down-regulate SOD3, catalase, glutathione S-transferases, and peroxiredoxins 1, 3, and 6. In contrast, HRV does not affect activity of SOD2, catalase, and GPx, but increase levels and activity of SOD1.\n\nFor SeV, we did not find any literature on interference of the virus with expression of antioxidant defense enzymes. However, a fluctuating reduction of the total GSH content has been reported in SeV-infected cells. Noteworthy, this decrease was observed during the first hour post-infection and then again 24 h post-infection. Initial reduction of GSH content was due to damage of the host cell membrane during virus penetration, whereas the secondary reduction resulted from massive incorporation of cysteine into the viral proteome. However, in neither case, any changes in levels of GSSG were observed.\n\nIn addition to Nrf2, there are other transcription factors that belong to this family: Nrf1 and Nrf3. To date very little is known about functions of Nrf3 in the absence of infection. Functions of Nrf1 are defined. Nrf1 can also bind to ARE in the promoters of antioxidant defense genes, though to a lesser extent than Nrf2. Nrf2 and Nrf1 knockout animals have distinct phenotype meaning that functions of these two factors do not fully overlap. But again, there are no data about status of Nrf1 during respiratory as well as other viruses. So, the investigation of their effect on Nrf1 and study of a role of the latter in viral replication and pathology seems to be a nice direction for future studies."}, {"heading": "Role Of Ros In The Life Cycle And Propagation Of Respiratory Viruses", "text": "Verily, the evidence for a direct impact of ROS upon the life cycles of respiratory viruses is scant. The death and lysis of cells induced by ROS may favor the release and spread of virions, thereby stimulating the replication of those respiratory viruses with a lytic life cycle. At the same time, ROS are known to contribute to the suppression of some respiratory infections through the induction of innate immune responses. On the other hand, therapies that are antioxidant in nature are known to ameliorate and improve disease outcome.\n\nOverexpression of SOD1 or treatment with antioxidants reduces intracellular levels of IV polymerase, thus providing a possible mechanism of the viral titer reduction in response to antioxidant treatment. The observation that the content of GSH negatively correlates with IV replication in infected cells or mice further corroborates this finding. Similar results were obtained upon the inhibition of additional ROS-producing enzymes or Nox2 knockout. However, ROS were also shown to have an antiviral effect, but due to modulation of immune responses.\n\nActivation of immune responses during IV infection is achieved partly through Duox2-mediated induction of viral dsRNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5, pattern recognition receptors that trigger type I IFN responses. IV also enhances the production of interferons \u03bb1 (IL29), and \u03bb2/3 (IL28A/IL28B), again via ROS. ROS scavenging or suppression of ROS production by Duox2 or mitochondria leads to the inhibition of IFN\u03bb synthesis and secretion, and thus the enhancement of viral replication. Induction of type I and III interferons is likely to be achieved through the Nrf2 pathway, since activation of the latter in response to IV infection or chemical inducers (i.e., sulforaphane and epigallocatechin gallate) is accompanied by an increased expression of antiviral mediators RIG-I, IFN\u03b2, and MxA. Nrf2 overexpression negatively affects the replication of IV, whereas knockdown leads to enhanced virus entry and replication. However, this effect is unlikely to be mediated through interferon-stimulated genes, such as MX1 and OAS1 (2 ,5 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1), since their levels are not altered during Nrf2 overexpression in the absence of the infection and are decreased in infected cells.\n\nOne of the mechanisms by which IV interferes with the interferon pathway is via the activation of the ROS-sensitive transcriptional factor NF\u03baB, which controls proinflammatory cytokine production. Indeed, in IV-infected cells SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) is induced through the activation of NF\u03baB, whereas prevention of NF\u03baB activation leads to the reduction of viral titers, but cytokine production also decreased. Another proviral role of NF\u03baB is the inhibition of \u03b2and \u03b3-catenin-dependent transcription of interferon-stimulated genes. However, NF\u03baB can also exhibit antiviral properties by activating interferon \u03b2 gene transcription. Viral protein NS1 is able to prevent NF\u03baB activation by interacting with IKK, which is required for NF\u03baB signaling. Overall, the balance between pro-and anti-viral activities of NF\u03baB remains to be analyzed.\n\nAn interesting piece of evidence came from an investigation of SeV and its effects on the expression of Duox2. It showed that the replication of this virus is controlled by Duox2 and by the H 2 O 2 Duox2 produces. Induction of Duox2 in SeV-infected cells is achieved through a combined action of IFN\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 that are synthesized and secreted from the infected cells through IRF3 and NF\u03baB, respectively. In turn, Duox2 contributes to secretion of type I and III interferons. However, it should be mentioned that the detailed mechanism underlying the antiviral effect of Duox2 remains vague, and several possible assumptions have been made.\n\nHRSV is known to evade the antiviral effect of Duox2. Fink et al. showed that HRSV triggers the production and secretion of functional IFN\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 to a level comparable to that known to induce Duox2 in SeV infection. However, HRSV blocks the Stat2/IRF9 pathway and thus controls Duox2 gene expression. Other groups found that activation of IFNs by HRSV is achieved through enhanced ROS production and the consequent STAT signaling. Among the various ROS-sources, NADPH oxidases are the major triggers of STAT signaling, since treatment with Nox inhibitors abrogates STAT and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted) induction. Specifically, HRSV-and SeV-induced activation of NF\u03baB and IRF3 signaling and downstream proinflammatory and antiviral signaling is initiated by sensing viral RNA by Rig-I and MDA5 helicase receptors with subsequent involvement of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) adaptors. All of these processes depend on Nox2, which controls the expression of MAVS. Not much is known about the mechanisms of viral interference with the above mentioned pathway, however nonstructural viral proteins NS1 and NS2 are thought to be implied, albeit in an opposing way-these proteins inhibit IFN, IRF-3, and NF\u03baB activation. Thus, the virus antagonizes IFN signaling.\n\nThe role of ROS in the life cycle of HRV remains mostly unexplored. However, ROS have been reported to stimulate the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), a major receptor for entry of this virus. In line with this, treatment with reduced GSH decreased virus-mediated ICAM1 activation.\n\nFinally, an interesting piece of evidence comes from the investigation of SeV. Ciriolo et al. showed that this virus causes a pronounced decrease in GSH content in infected cells. Supplementation with exogenous GSH inhibits the replication of the virus, whereas depletion, as caused by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) that interferes with biosynthesis of this tripeptide, in contrast-increases virus titers. However, the exact mechanism by which GSH content is linked to virus replication remains unknown. It definitely does not involve modulation of mitochondrial status, as mitochondria-derived ROS do not affect SeV propagation. Finally, such investigations are missing for other respiratory viral infections."}, {"heading": "Ros In Respiratory Virus Pathology", "text": "Verily, changes in the pathways that produce and scavenge ROS, brought about by respiratory viral infections, are implicated in inflammation, disruption of lung epithelia, tissue damage, and in some cases, even pulmonary fibrosis. These events are at least partially interregulated: inflammation can contribute to lung damage and epithelial dysfunction and vice versa. While there is a clear correlation between markers of oxidative stress and severity of the disease in chronic hepatitis B and C, for respiratory viruses, such clinical data are scarce. The observation that ROS are implicated in the pathology of these viruses is mainly based on experimental infection models. Death of lung epithelial cells that are infected with IV in vitro occurs through enhanced ROS production, whereas antioxidants prevent cell death and also reduce damage in lungs of IV-infected mice. GPx1 was shown to play a particular role in the pathogenicity of IV infection. In mice lacking H 2 O 2 -scavenging enzyme, GPx1, IV infection results in a more severe and longer BALF inflammation as compared to their wild type littermates. Moreover, these animals exhibit higher levels of proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), macrophage inflammatory proteins MIP-1a and MIP-2 expression in lung and elevated number of IV-specific CD8 + T cells in spleen. Such decrease of GPx1 can also result from selenium deficiency. Selenium deficiency leads to down-regulation of GPx1 and catalase and increased production of mucosa and altered epithelial morphology. However, there are no direct data showing that IV does interfere with selenium metabolism and expression of the key Se-metabolizing proteins.\n\nSimilar data that point to an important role of ROS in the associated pathology also exist for SARS-CoV and HRSV. DNA damage and a proliferation arrest with consequent activation of cellular senescence program was observed in HRSV-infected immortalized epithelial cells and in the respiratory epithelia of HRSV-infected mice even after viral clearance. Overexpression of catalase, treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or with cell-permeable reduced glutathione ethyl ester (GSHee) reversed these effects, strongly implying the accumulation of ROS in these events. However, contradictory data also exist. For example, Olsen et al. demonstrated that influenza A and B-induced apoptosis of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells cannot be blocked by antioxidants or compounds protecting mitochondria; moreover, the cell permeable calcium chelator BAPTA-AM severely augmented cell death, whereas ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, blocked apoptosis. For SeV the data are contradictory: Gao et al. reported that virus-induced apoptosis can be prevented by treatment with NAC, whereas Bitzer et al. found that the activation of caspases in SeV-infected cells is not sensitive to antioxidants.\n\nOne of the key events of inflammation is the interaction of airway epithelial and endothelial cells with leukocytes. It is mediated by a set of cell adhesion molecules, such as VCAM1 (vascular cell adhesion protein 1), ICAM1, and E-selectin, which trigger and augment infiltration with leukocytes. At least for HRV it was demonstrated that infection leads to induction of ICAM1. ICAM1 induction was successfully blocked by addition of reduced GSH showing that ROS play a particular role in endothelial cell mediated leukocyte recruitment.\n\nIt is well known that IV, HRSV, and other viral infections in vivo trigger massive production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF\u03b1, IL6, and IL8, referred to as cytokine storm and thus trigger cell death. The cytokine storm is responsible for lung tissue damage during viral respiratory infections. Activation of immune cells is also necessary for infection elimination, but it should be taken into account that in many cases not viruses themselves, but associated host immune response is more fatal for tissue integrity and functionality. One of the key mediators of induction of cytokines and chemokines is NF\u03baB. NF\u03baB signaling is directly activated by ROS or/and by certain proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2, and drives in turn expression of a wide spectrum of other cytokines and chemokines. These include interleukins 2, 6m and 8, MIP1a, MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), and RANTES. Consequently, NF\u03baB is a key player that coordinates initiation of innate and inflammatory responses as well as maturation of lymphocytes within the adaptive immune system. Respiratory viruses induce NF\u03baB signaling both in vitro and in vivo in a ROS-dependent fashion. Several IV proteins, including M, HA, and NP activate NF\u03baB. In IV-infected mice, NF\u03baB activation is accompanied by the increased production of IL6 and IL8, TNF\u03b1, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine 10). Treatment with NAC abolishes NF\u03baB activation and cytokine production in infected cells. However, contrary data also exist: Mastronarde et al. noticed that although induction of IL8 by RSV is sensitive to antioxidants such as NAC, the latter inhibits binding of AP-1 and NF-IL6 factors to the promoter region of IL8 gene, but it does not affect the binding of NF\u03baB. So, a precise action of ROS in induction of proinflammatory cytokines merits further studies.\n\nMechanisms of cytokine induction by HRV infection are less clear. On the one hand, low molecular weight antioxidants including NAC and reduced GSH abolish both NF\u03baB activation and cytokine production during HRV-infection, thus pointing to ROS as key mediators of both effects. Moreover, XO has a significant input in NF\u03baB, since its inhibitor allopurinol effectively prevents the activation of this transcription factor in a cell culture model. Several other studies pointed to Nox2-generated ROS as triggers of NF\u03baB activation and concomitant production of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF\u03b1 and RANTES. However, Kim et al. reported that HRV infection can induce IL6 and IL8 in an NF\u03baB-independent manner. Distinct mechanisms seem to activate NF\u03baB during HRV infection, and they imply NLRX-1-mediated ROS generation. Not much is known about HMPV-mediated cytokine induction. Although HMPV activates NF\u03baB, just like other respiratory viruses, its SH protein, when being expressed by itself, is capable of preventing this activation.

Infection doth lead to enhanced ROS production, which may trigger cell death and subsequent macrophage activation. This activation is accompanied by cytokine production, leading to inflammation and destruction of epithelial cell contacts. Infected cells may also produce proinflammatory cytokines via activation of the redox-sensitive nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) pathway, which drives transcription of their genes, and via activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in ROS-dependent manner, which mediates maturation and secretion of cytokines.

More detailed data may be found in the following reviews [101,[176][177][178].\n\nThe most studied agents targeting ROS that were evaluated for the treatment of IV and HRSV infections are listed in Table 1. Notably, almost no data exist regarding the efficacy of antioxidant therapies in humans. Instead, the most studied antioxidants-NAC, ascorbic acid, and vitamin E-were shown to have positive effects such as a decrease in virus replication and inflammation in cells and mice infected with IV and/or HRSV.\n\nIt should be noted that there is no strong link between HRSV viral titer and the severity of disease during antioxidant treatment. For example, treatment with an inhibitor of NO production ameliorates inflammation during HRSV infection, but it increases viral replication both in cell culture and in a mouse model [179,180]. Another interesting approach for antioxidant treatment proposed recently is the usage of hydrogen sulfide donors [181]. This approach is based on the fact that HRSV infection is accompanied by the depletion of H 2 S due to decreased expression of H 2 S-generating enzyme cystathionine \u03b3-liase (CSE) [182]. Since H 2 S and its donors are able to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and reduce inflammation, this fact provides another piece of evidence that respiratory viruses interfere with cellular redox-sensitive pathways.\n\nAn additional strategy is the inhibition of ROS-generating enzymes such as Nox2 in the case of IV. A detailed analysis of such an approach is presented in several excellent reviews [183,184]. Briefly, the most studied inhibitors, gp91dstat and apocynin, inhibit the association of Nox2 with p47 phox and prevent the assembly of the active complex of the oxidase. Both of the inhibitors were shown to reduce inflammation in IV-infected mice, thus validating the perspectiveness of antioxidant therapy of IV [48,50]. * No antiviral activity [31]; antiviral activity was reported [32,143,189]. ** No data. *** Not studied, ND [206,207]; antiviral activity was reported [208].\n\nData on the treatment of HRV with antioxidants are scarce and have only been produced in in vitro systems. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an antioxidant and inhibitor of NF\u03baB, inhibits HRV replication and the processing of the viral polyprotein in cells [211,212]. Other well-studied antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, Trolox, 2-mercaptoethanol, and NAC, do not display any promising therapeutic activity [211]. Carbocisteine and ambroxol reduce HRV titers at least partly via down-regulation of the viral receptor ICAM1 [213,214]."}, {"heading": "Conclusions And Future Perspectives", "text": "Verily, respiratory viruses doth cause millions of cases of severe illness and thousands of deaths each year. Hitherto, no efficient measures for prevention and treatment doth exist. Future research in these areas shall be of utmost importance. These infections are associated with pronounced inflammation. Importantly, the virus-induced production of ROS and disturbance of the host's redox balance are important triggers of inflammation. Oxidative stress is triggered in many distinct ways, including the induction of ROS-generating enzymes and disturbance of antioxidant defense. However, not enough is known about mechanisms of virus-associated oxidative stress and the subsequent consequences for cells, tissue, and the organism. Many conflicting data on the antioxidant defense status and role of ROS in viral propagation exist and need to be resolved based on in vitro as well as clinical studies. In particular, techniques that allow for localizing ROS production and scavenging within the cell, and to trace exact oxidative reactions of ROS with host cell proteins will be required to resolve these questions.\n\nProduction of ROS can induce cell death and the release of virions representing possible proviral role of enhanced ROS production and altered redox balance. On the other hand, one of the important roles of oxidative stress is the triggering of an antiviral immune response. However, too strong immune responses lead to a cytokine storm and severe inflammation, which is very dangerous for tissue and may disturb lung function. From this point of view, antioxidant supplementation is expected to ameliorate the consequences of infection. Many studies showed the positive role of antioxidant therapy in infected cells and animals. At the same time, almost no relevant clinical data exist even for popular antioxidants, such as NAC, ascorbic acid, and vitamin E. This gap needs to be filled in by new research."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{wang2017exploring,\n  title={Exploring the Role of Redox Signaling in Respiratory Viral Infections},\n  author={Wang, Yuyan and Liu, Xiang and Liu, Hong and Li, Yan and Li, Jianguo},\n  journal={Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology},\n  volume={7},\n  pages={39},\n  year={2017},\n  publisher={Frontiers}\n}\n\n@article{halliwell2007oxidative,\n  title={Oxidative stress and neurodegeneration: where are we now?},\n  author={Halliwell, Barry},\n  journal={Journal of neurochemistry},\n  volume={97},\n  number={6},\n  pages={1634--1658},\n  year={2007},\n  publisher={Wiley Online Library}\n}\n\n@article{halliwell2006reactive,\n  title={Reactive species and antioxidants.
