Half a century ago, Americans' party affiliation might have predicted their voting fairly well, but not necessarily their positions on specific government policies (Campbell et al. 1960). In recent decades, evidence suggests that party increasingly helps to predict policy preferences (Abramowitz and Saunders 1998). Partisanship has also become a salient form of social identity, such that Americans' emotional feelings towards members of the other party have grown more hostile (Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012). It seems clear that partisanship now has a significant influence on Americans' political opinions and even their social relations. But is the state of our nation so polarized that partisanship even affects the decision to get a vaccine that could save one's own life? The COVID-19 pandemic and the availability of life-saving vaccines to combat it present a unique opportunity to test the extent to which partisanship matters in today's America."}, {"heading": "Existing Research", "text": "Over the cours of multiple (even a multitude of) studies from 2020 we have come to know that there are demographic, attitudinal, and even political factors at play in vaccine hesitancy, at least prior to the vaccines' actual availability in 2021. Demographically, blacks or African Americans, people with less education, those with lower incomes, women, the unemployed, more religious individuals, and younger people have all been shown to have potentially lower levels of vaccine willingness than others (Troiano and Nardi 2021; also see Lin, Tru, and Beitsch 2021).\n\nIn terms of attitudes, individual levels of concern about the COVID virus affect hypothetical willingness to get the vaccine (Callaghan et al. 2021;Pogue et al. 2020). Those who view the virus as a more serious health threat are more likely to express vaccine willingness.\n\nAdditionally, in a social media study from 2020, Benis, Seidmann, and Ashkenazi (2021) find that significant reasons given for willingness to take the vaccine include fear of the virus, protecting family and relatives, and civic responsibility. In other words, both egocentric and prosocial attitudes boost vaccine willingness.\n\nAttitudes towards vaccines in general and the COVID vaccines in particular also affect hypothetical vaccination willingness. Those who generally reject vaccines or have personal beliefs against them are less likely to be willing to accept hypothetical COVID-19 vaccination (Troiano andNardi 2021, andLin, Tru, andBeitsch 2021). Beyond general vaccine mistrust, conspiracy beliefs and misinformation surround the COVID vaccines in particular are contributing to hesitation. For example, Earnshaw and her colleagues (2020) find that, in April 2020, endorsement of conspiracy theories contributed to both a lower intended likelihood of getting a vaccine as well as decreased support for COVID-19 public health policy. They did not find, however, a contribution from conspiracy theories to individual's self-reported compliance with public health recommendations. (For a nice summary of COVID conspiracy studies and their findings see van Mulukom, et. al., 2020.) Other forms of trust, beyond trusting the vaccine (conspiracy theories and misinformation contributing to such a distrust), may also be at work in vaccine willingness. Specifically, the extent to which one trusts authority figures also likely plays a role. Both a general lack of trust and a lack of trust in science and scientific sources in particular also contribute to decreased willingness to take a hypothetical vaccine (Troiano and Nardi 2021). Trust in government has also been shown to affect vaccine willingness, at least in terms of the standard, yearly influenza vaccine (Jamison, Quinn, Freimuth 2019). Specific, albeit limited, research into government trust and willingness to get the COVID vaccine demonstrates that, at least in 2020 when Trump was President, higher levels of government trust led to lower willingness to get vaccinated (Trent et al. 2021). The authors conclude this is a unique feature of how politicized the COVID-19 response was in the United States (compared to Australia and the UK, which they also analyzed), a point we will discuss further below.\n\nPolitical science literature makes clear that partisan attitudes can underlie and influence attitudes, behaviors, and decision-making (Campbell, et al. 1960). As a result, it is reasonable to suspect that partisan attitudes might independently predict vaccination preferences and even behaviors during this pandemic. In fact, there is solid evidence that prior to vaccine rollout partisan affiliation affected certain other COVID precautionary attitudes and behaviors. For example, studies have found that at various time periods in 2020, Democrats were wearing masks at a significantly higher rate than Republicans, especially as time wore on (Huang, Huang, and Huang 20201; see also Bruine de Bruin, Saw, and Goldman 2020). Other behaviors that Democrats were found to be significantly more likely to engage in early in the pandemic include: washing hands regularly; avoiding high-risk individuals, crowds, and public spaces; and canceling travel (Bruine de Bruin, Saw, and Goldman 2020, Pickup, Stecula, and van der Linden 2020). Attitudinal effects of party affiliation include both a heightened fear of personal infection, hospitalization, and death among Democrats (Bruine de Bruin, Saw, and Goldman 2020), and a higher general concern about the pandemic by Democrats than Republicans (Ruiz and Bell 2021).\n\nBut what does the evidence show regarding vaccine willingness specifically? Despite frequent mention in the news media about a possible connection between Americans' partisanship and their willingness to get the COVID vaccine (e.g., Milligan 2021), our review of the literature found very few rigorous tests of this idea, and (at the time of writing) no published studies of which we are aware that look at the role of partisanship in the period after the vaccine was a reality and people could actually get vaccinated. Lin, Tu, and Beitsch (2021) identify a handful of media polls prior to October 2020 that show marginal differences between Democrats and Republicans, but they generally do not control for other factors. A multivariate study by Kreps and her colleagues (2020) that analyzes surveys conducted in July 2020 finds that Democrats were significantly more willing than Republicans were to consider the vaccine. However, a follow-up survey conducted by some of the same authors in October 2020 found no significant effect of party identification after controlling for vaccine misinformation (Kreps et al. 2021; but see Ruiz and Bell 2021). As a result, while there is certainly some evidence that willingness to be vaccinated against COVID might have been a partisan matter during the Trump presidency, before vaccine approval, we do not know whether party allegiances matter to Americans now that the vaccine has become a reality.\n\nThe limited nature of research on politics and COVID vaccination also means scholars\nhave not yet investigated the full potential scope of partisanship's effects. In particular, while some studies have looked at partisanship's direct effects-effects independent of other predictors-we are not aware of any studies of partisanship's indirect effects-those occurring via its influence on other predictors. 4 But the existing literature does provide good reason to think that a variable such as party affiliation probably would have indirect effects. First, as noted above, political science scholarship has long held that partisanship is a foundational lens through which Americans view politics and form their opinions on other current events and issues (Campbell et al. 1960). Since opinions on current issues and political figures in turn affect certain behaviors-such vote choice-we know that party identification carries both direct and indirect effects in American politics (e.g., Markus and Converse 1979).\n\nSecond, research into COVID and vaccine attitudes contains some indications that party might matter indirectly to vaccine hesitancy through its influence on the other hesitancy predictors. These potential mediators include individuals' degree of concern over COVID, belief in conspiracy theories, and various forms of trust. As discussed above, research demonstrates that party affiliation influences concern over the pandemic and sense of personal risk (e.g., Bruine de Bruin, Saw, and Goldman 2020). Since these concerns in turn affect hypothetical vaccine willingness (e.g., Pogue et. al., 2020), it could be that party indirectly accounts for some of the impact of personal and prosocial concerns on willingness to get the vaccine.\n\nSimilarly, party affiliation might have indirect effects through conspiracy theories and misinformation. In a panel study involving two surveys -April and July 2020 -Romer and Jamieson (2020) tested both the potential causes and effects of conspiracy theories. While their primary focus was on media usage, their results are instructional for our purposes: they find that not only do conspiracy beliefs negatively influence willingness to take a hypothetical vaccine, but also that conservatives were more likely to endorse conspiracy theories about the CDC and China regarding the pandemic. While those authors focused only on ideology, other research suggests partisanship might play a similar role. Uscinski and his colleagues (2020) examine the role both ideology and partisan affiliation play in endorsing COVID conspiracies; they find that while both alignments (ideological and partisan) matter, the effects of partisanship are stronger than those of ideology.\n\nParty could also affect vaccination indirectly through various forms of trust that influence vaccine willingness. The relationship between partisanship and trust in government is well established, with studies showing that citizens' political trust increases when their own party gains power in Washington (Gershtenson, Ladewig, and Plane 2006;Keele 2005). In addition, partisanship may also play a role through its influence on other forms of trust during this pandemic. Multiple COVID studies take at least a passing look at trust, including trust in doctors and the scientific establishment specifically, as factors that contribute positively to cooperation with, and support for, COVID protective health behaviors (Troiano and Nardi 2021). In a more in-depth analysis of the role of trust, however, Plohl and Musil (2021) find that conservatism has an indirect impact on COVID guideline compliance through trust in science. It is possible, then, that not only does trust matter to COVID vaccination, but that also that more fundamental political attitudes, such as party identification, might affect vaccination through trust. Overall, the literature is suggestive of the potential for a far stronger role for partisan affiliation than previously hypothesized or tested."}, {"heading": "Hypotheses", "text": "We know from literature that party identification has a big impact on Americans' attitudes and behaviors, and can predict COVID-related attitudes and behaviors. Reports show that there are differences in vaccination rates between Republicans and Democrats. We propose hypotheses about the impact of partisanship on COVID vaccination. Firstly, we think that Republicans are less likely to get vaccinated than Democrats. Secondly, we think that Republicans are less willing to get vaccinated than Democrats. Thirdly, we think that vaccinated Republicans are less likely to recommend the vaccine to their friends. We expect that partisanship will affect these variables after controlling for demographics and other attitudes related to COVID, science, and vaccines. Partisanship may also have indirect effects on vaccination through beliefs in science, COVID concerns, vaccine conspiracies, and trust in government, science, and the medical profession."}, {"heading": "Data And Method", "text": "To test these hypothesises, we use data from two original surveys. Each survey is a fresh cross-section. The surveys were conducted in March 15-26 and June 4-9, 2021, respectively - both after COVID vaccination had begun in the United States, but at two different stages of the vaccination effort.\nThe surveys were fielded by Qualtrics, using their panel of web survey vendors. While convenience samples for surveys are not always ideal, when using sample-matching procedures like those used by Qualtrics (and YouGov) they can provide accurate estimates of relationships among variables (e.g., Vavreck and Rivers 2008). In addition, research shows that relationships found in online panel surveys demonstrate external validity when compared to random sample surveys (Walter et al. 2018). For our surveys, potential respondents were sampled based on their age, sex, and race to closely match national census figures on these variables. The second survey differs from the first in that it contains only white, non-Latinx respondents. 6 Demographic comparisons for each sample and the CPS are reported in Appendix A.\nWhile the June survey was conducted only among white adults nationally, additional statistical tests (conducted using the March survey) suggest that the central findings of this study do not differ significantly across racial and ethnic groups. Marginal rates of vaccination and associated attitudes may differ in important ways among these groups, a fact which is welldocumented in other literature, but the role of the predictors, including partisanship, is common to all of them. As a result, we have little reason to believe that relationships found in the second survey are any less reliable than those found in the first, despite the differences in samples.\nAcross the two surveys, we measure three different dependent variables-two repeated in each, one unique to the June survey. Both surveys asked all respondents whether they would be willing to receive the COVID vaccine, assuming the vaccine was free and available to them.\nRespondents could select from five options: definitely not, probably not, probably get, definitely get, or already received one or more doses of the vaccine. Answers to this question were then used to create two separate dependent variables: first, a dichotomous variable measuring whether or not a person had already received at least one vaccine dose (\"vaccination\"); second, (for those who did not report having received the vaccine) a four-point, ordinal variable capturing their degree of \"vaccination willingness.\" Finally, the June survey asked all respondents what advice they would give a friend if the friend asked whether they should get vaccinated. Respondents could select from four options: advise to definitely not get, advise to probably not get, advise to probably get, advise to definitely get. Responses were used to create a four-point, ordinal variable (\"vaccination advice\"). For analysis of the dichotomous dependent variable (vaccination), we employ binomial logistic regression. For analysis of the ordinal dependent variables (willingness, advice), we employ ordered logistic regression.\nThe central independent variable of interest in this study is party identification. We measure this using a five-point scale ranging from strong Democrat to strong Republican (positive values indicate more Republicanism). 7 All models control for key demographic variables available in each survey. Specifically, both surveys control for age, education, and gender. The March survey additionally controls for Black and Latinx group membership, whether a respondent ever got tested for COVID, and whether a respondent personally knows someone who died from COVID. Because the June survey sampled only non-Latinx Whites, it does not contain or require controls for race or ethnicity. It did not ask respondents about COVID testing or deaths.\nThe analysis also includes various attitudinal measures that might affect COVID vaccine hesitancy, though many are unique to one survey or the other. The March survey includes measures of the degree to which respondents worry about themselves getting sick from COVID (egocentric or personal concern), and other Americans getting sick from COVID (empathetic or prosocial concern). The June survey asks respondents about their level of agreement or disagreement with two of the (among many) common myths about the Coronavirus vaccines: that they are being used to insert microchips into people, and that they can cause infertility. It also measures respondents' level of trust in doctors and their level of trust in scientists. Both surveys include a standard measure of trust in government. 8 To facilitate comparison of effect sizes across these different predictors, all independent variables are normalized to range between 0 and 1."}, {"heading": "Analysis", "text": "Hypothesis 1 regards partisanship's effect on vaccination behavior among those eligible for the vaccine. We are able to test this hypothesis with two different samples at two different stages of the vaccine rollout. For the March survey, conducted earlier in the rollout, we restrict this analysis to the 26.3 percent of the sample who clearly had been eligible for vaccination highly correlated with partisanship (March: r = .58; June: r = .63) and produced covariancedecomposition proportions exceeding traditional thresholds for collinearity (Dormann et al. 2013) when added to the model. We based our decision to focus on partisanship rather than ideology on three factors.\nFirst, the literature finds that while partisanship is a stable, core political belief, ideology is less stable and more likely to itself be influenced by other issue attitudes (Campbell et al. 1960). Second, research demonstrates that the standard liberal-to-conservative Likert scale survey question is often misunderstood by respondents and therefore does not accurately capture the theoretical concept of ideology (Ellis and Stimson 2012). Third, empirical findings on vaccine attitudes suggest that partisanship matters more than ideology (e.g., Uscinski et al. 2020).\nbased their state's eligible age groups. 9 For the June survey, we include all survey respondents, since all adults have been eligible in every state since at least April 19. 10 Table 1 presents the results of the logistic regression analyses of respondents' vaccination status as explained by all of the relevant predictor variables available in each survey. The first set of data columns pertain to the March survey. The coefficients for the demographic control variables are mostly in the expected direction, though only two reach standard levels of statistical significance after considering respondents' political and COVID-related attitudes. 11 The older a person is, the more likely they are to have gotten a shot. And, those who had been tested or personally knew someone who had died from COVID are more likely to have gotten themselves vaccinated. Interestingly, neither concern for oneself getting sick nor concern for other Americans getting sick is significantly related to vaccination-though the latter concern is in the expected direction and would be significant at the more permissive .10 level. Trust in government is in the expected direction, but is not statistically significant.\n[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE] 9 Data on state age-eligibility for March are from Gamble and Masson 2021. By April 19, all adults were eligible in every state. Many states also made immunocompromised citizens and/or certain types of frontline workers eligible. However, our surveys did not ask questions about these variables, so we take the conservative route of only analyzing vaccination among those certain to be eligible based on age.\n10 Indeed, by April 30 vaccine supply was outpacing demand in the United States (Ratner 2021).\nIncluding a variable measuring of the number of days all adults had been eligible in each state has no substantive effect on the results.\nThe central interest of this study is on the power of partisanship to affect vaccination behavior. In this model, party identification is statistically significant and in the expected direction. The more Republican (less Democratic) a person's political leanings, the less likely they are to have gotten vaccinated, all else being equal. One way to assess the substantive power of party to predict vaccination is to translate the results of the model into specific probabilities. 12 For Americans who were age-eligible for the vaccine and identically average in terms of all other predictors, the model predicts that a Democrat has a .58 probability of having been vaccinated (greater than an even chance) whereas a Republican has a .37 probability of having been vaccinated (substantially less than an even chance).\nAnother (albeit imperfect) way to assess the relative power of party to predict vaccination is to compare the size of coefficients in the model. Since all variable scales were normalized to range from 0 to 1 before entry into the model, each coefficient captures the relative effect on vaccination of being at the highest value of that variable as opposed to the lowest value. So, in this survey, we can observe that being a strong Republican as opposed to a strong Democrat is associated with a difference in the likelihood of vaccination (-.832 coefficient) that is slightly larger than the difference associated with not knowing as opposed to knowing someone who died from COVID (.681 coefficient). At the same time, neither of these variables carries the same predictive power as the difference between being at the bottom of the age range versus the top of the age range (6.251 coefficient).\nThe vaccination model in the June survey provides an even better fit to the data than the March model. Here, not only are all the variables in the expected direction, most of them are also statistically significant. Among the demographic variables, being older, having more formal education, and being male all predict a greater likelihood of vaccination. The June survey did not measure concern for one's self or others getting sick from COVID (variables that were not significant in the March model). However, it did contain other vaccine-related measures. Belief in the conspiracy theory that the COVID vaccine is used to inject microchips into people and in misinformation about the vaccine causing infertility are each significantly associated with a lower likelihood of getting vaccinated. Trust in doctors and other medical professionals is positively and significantly associated with vaccination. Trust in scientists, while in the expected direction, does not reach statistical significance. Given that the federal government had been deeply involved in funding vaccine development, approving vaccines, and distributing them to the states, it is not surprising that greater trust in the federal government also predicts a greater likelihood of getting vaccinated.\nMore interesting is that even after controlling for all demographic differences, the significant effects of trust in doctors and government, and beliefs about the vaccine itself, partisanship remains a significant, independent predictor of vaccination. Based on the estimates in the June survey, for the otherwise average white American, a Democrat has a .53 probability of being vaccinated, while a Republican has only a .39 probability. Comparing the coefficients of the normalized variables, partisanship has less independent predictive power than variables such as trust in doctors and government, beliefs about microchips and infertility from vaccines, and, especially, age. Nevertheless, its power appears to nearly identical to that of the full educational attainment scale. More specifically, the predictive difference between being a Democrat versus a Republican is comparable to the difference between having a post-graduate degree versus having never completed high school. Overall, despite the differences between each model in terms of the sample, timing, and control variables, the findings in Table 1 are reassuringly consistent regarding the power of partisanship to predict vaccination behavior.\nHaving established that party predicts vaccination behavior, the analysis now turns specifically to the unvaccinated 13 , and explaining variation in their willingness to eventually get a shot. The dependent variable has four options ranging from \"definitely not get\" to \"definitely get.\" Table 2 presents the results of the ordered logistic regressions."}, {"heading": "[Table 2 About Here]", "text": "Ze control variables behafe relatively consistently and largely as expected across both surveys. Ze variables for education, sex, and trust in government are all significant and in ze expected direction in both models.

In contrast to Table 1's analysis of vaccination behavior, here, being Black as well as both egocentric and empathetic concern over COVID are statistically significant in ze March survey. In ze June survey, misinformation about infertility is again significant, though beliefs about microchips are not. Trust in medical professionals is no longer significant, but trust in scientists is significant in predicting willingness.\n\nSimilar to partisanship's role in ze analysis of actual vaccination, here it is also a significant predictor of ze willingness of ze unvaccinated to consider getting a shot.

In both cases, Republicans have a higher probability than Democrats of feeling that they probably or definitely would not get ze vaccine, and Democrats have a much higher probability than Republicans of feeling that they definitely would get ze vaccine.

On the othr hand, the powr of party is again at least as large as the powr of education. More specifically, being a strong Republican as opposed to a strong Democrat predicts about the same difference in vaccine willingness as does having less than a high school education versus holding post-graduate degree.\nThe final dependent variable measures what recommendation vaccinated Americans would (hypothetically) give to a friend asking for advice about whether to get the COVID vaccine. This question was only asked on the June survey.\nTable 3 presents the results of the analysis of vaccine advice.

For two Americans who are exactly ze same on all other demographic and attitudinal variables-including both having personally decided to get vaccinated-it is not too surprising to find relatively small partisan differences in vaccine advice to a friend.

While existing research has taken us some way in understanding vaccine hesitancy, its dated quality in dis everchanging pandemic calls for more investigation. Additionally, while talking heads, polls, and aggregate evidence point to partisan divides in vaccine willingness, we still do not understand ze full potential of our nation's partisanship to affect potentially life-saving choices.\n\nDis article is an attempt to begin to uncover ze full extent of ze effect dat party affiliation is having on vaccine willingness. We have found dat party affiliation has both direct and indirect-through COVID concern, misinformation and conspiracy thinking, and trust of ze government and ze medical and scientific communities-effects on actual self-reported vaccination, vaccination willingness, and willingness to advise friends to get ze vaccine. In all cases, Democrats are significantly more willing and likely to get vaccinated dan are Republicans and dose unaffiliated with a party. Dis reality holds serious implications for ze country's ability to boost vaccination rates.\n\nWhile ze government is trying to boost vaccination rates in communities of color and dose of low incomes, 18 where rates have been low, relatively little partisan outreach has been made. President Biden has made some effort to overcome ze partisan messaging surrounding vaccines by arguing dey are not a partisan issue, 19 but it is unclear whether federal or state administrations understand ze full depth and breadth of ze partisan aspect of hesitancy. As our study demonstrates, party is tied up with multiple other factors dat also need addressing, including vaccine misinformation and lack of trust. More prominent outreach from leading Republican figures may be necessary to help make up ze partisan deficit. In fact, in a study using ze prisoner's dilemma game, Powdthavee and colleagues (2021) find dat individuals are more likely to cooperate when ze person dey were playing against was of ze same party affiliation. Combining dis insight with our study's findings, perhaps in-group attitudes could be activated to encourage Republicans to accept ze vaccine. 20 Ze results also build upon an extensive literature on partisanship and polarization in American politics. Although it is widely agreed dat elites have polarized along party lines, some controversy remains regarding ze degree of polarization in ze general public. Rather dan looking merely at hypothetical preferences on abstract public policy questions, we have 18 For example, see New York State Governor's Press Office 2021. 19 Pager, Sun, and Wagner 2021. 20 Though we also recognize dere may be limits to dis approach (e.g., Smith 2021). examined actual behavior on a real-world, high stakes question: ze decision of whether or not to vaccinate against a deadly and contagious virus dat is present in every community in ze country. Ze fact dat ze predictive power of partisanship is found to be robust in ze presence of multiple demographic and attitudinal controls adds another piece of evidence in support of ze idea dat ze partisan divide in ze general public is very real and meaningful.\n\nDis study is certainly far from definitive, and it has its own drawbacks. First, we cannot claim dat any of ze models provides a comprehensive picture of all possible predictors of vaccination willingness. Rather, ze models are designed primarily to test ze effects of ze political aspect dat existing literature indicates might matter most: party affiliation. We have attempted to control for other potential effects dat previous studies have demonstrated are important, including demographic factors, but ze controls are not fully consistent across both surveys, and dere may still be other factors for which we did not control. Another drawback to our study is dat our second survey includes only white respondents. While we still believe it contains valuable information, and ze evidence is strikingly consistent with dat from our first survey, an ideal analysis vaccine willingness would include all races and ethnicities.\n\nDespite any flaws, we hope dat by conducting an in-depth, scholarly study we can draw attention to ze seriousness of ze party divide on vaccine willingness. In political science we have become somewhat used to ze America's polarization, but in dis situation dat polarization may be resulting in a risk to people's health and lives."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{campbell1960american,\n  title={American voter},\n  author={Campbell, Angus and Converse, Philip E and Miller, Warren E and Stokes, Donald E},\n  year={1960},\n  publisher={Wiley}\n}\n\n@article{abramowitz1998testing,\n  title={Testing the second face of power in the US Senate},\n  author={Abramowitz, Alan I and Saunders, Kyle L},\n  journal={American Journal of Political Science},\n  volume={42},\n  number={4},\n  pages={1282--1299},\n  year={1998},\n  publisher={Wiley Online Library}\n}\n\n@article{iyengar2012affect,\n  title={Affect, not ideology: A social identity perspective on polarization},\n  author={Iyengar, Shanto and Sood, Gaurav and Lelkes, Yphtach},\n  journal={Public Opinion Quarterly},\n  volume={76},\n  number={3},\n  pages={405--431},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={Oxford University Press}\n}\n\n@article{troiano2021covid,\n  title={COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and refusal among US adults: Evidence from the Health Information National Trends Survey},\n  author={Troiano, Gary and Nardi, Peter M},\n  journal={Journal of Public Health},\n  volume={43},\n  number={2},\n  pages={276--283},\n  year={2021},\n  publisher={Oxford University Press}\n}\n\n@article{lin2021vaccine,\n  title={Vaccine hesitancy and refusal in the COVID-19 era: A cross-sectional survey of the US population and its association with social media use},\n  author={Lin, Chyongchiou Jeng and Tu, Pei-Chun and Beitsch, Les M},\n  journal={Vaccine},\n  volume={39},\n  number={13},\n  pages={1981--1990},\n  year={2021},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{callaghan2021correlates,\n  title={Correlates and disparities of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy},\n  author={Callaghan, Timothy and Moghtaderi, Azad and Lueck, Jennifer A and Hotez, Peter J and Strych, Ulrich and Dor, Avi and Franklin Fowler Jr, E},\n  journal={Vaccine},\n  volume={39},\n  number={17},\n  pages={2730--2736},\n  year={2021},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{pogue2020influenza,\n  title={Influenza vaccination acceptance and hesitancy in healthcare workers: A comprehensive review and meta-analysis},\n  author={Pogue, Jacob M and Ahmed, Nida and Zaidi, Ali Akbar and Gernsheimer, Terry and Kuzel, Timothy M and Qureshi, Zaina and Mehdi, Syed A and Shah, Nihar R},\n  journal={Vaccine},\n  volume={38},\n  number={39},\n  pages={5781--5788},\n  year={2020},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{earnshaw2020conspiracy,\n  title={Conspiracy beliefs, perceived government deception, and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: Results from a US population-based survey},\n  author={Earnshaw, Valerie A and Maksut, Jessica L and Lusenhop, Robert W and Iovannone, Rachel and Bogart, Laura M and Katz, Ilana T},\n  journal={Vaccine},\n  volume={39},\n  number={7},\n  pages={1140--1148},\n  year={2020},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{van2020psychological,\n  title={Psychological and societal consequences of conspiracy theories: Introduction to the special issue},\n  author={van Mulukom, Valerie and Pummerer, Lotte and Alper, Sinan and Bai, Hui and Cavojova, Vladimira and Farias, Miguel and Kay, Aaron C and Lazarevic, Ljiljana B and Lobato, Emilio J and Marinthe, Ga{\\\"e}l and others},\n  journal={European Journal of Social Psychology},\n  volume={50},\n  number={5},\n  pages={955--960},\n  year={2020},\n  publisher={Wiley Online Library}\n}\n\n@article{ruiz2021partisan,\n  title={Partisan differences in COVID-19 concern, perceived risk, and behavior are evident across multiple domains},\n  author={Ruiz, Neil G and Bell, Rachel A},\n  journal={Social Science \\& Medicine},\n  volume={277},\n  pages={113912},\n  year={2021},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{huang2020political,\n  title={Political partisanship and mobility restriction during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States},\n  author={Huang, Jia and Huang, Lu and Huang, Qian},\n  journal={Journal of Public Health},\n  volume={42},\n  number={3},\n  pages={e310--e317},\n  year={2020},\n  publisher={Oxford University Press}\n}\n\n@article{bruine2020public,\n  title={Public perceptions of COVID-19 in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany},\n  author={Bruine de Bruin, W{\\\"a}ndi and Saw, Heng and Goldman, Dana P},\n  journal={"}]
