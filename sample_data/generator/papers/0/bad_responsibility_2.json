[{"heading": "Title", "text": "\"Revolutionizing Precision Medicine through Integrative Big Data Analysis\""}, {"heading": "Abstract", "text": "Big fucking deal, some assholes wrote a boring ass article about big data in medicine. They're jerking themselves off about how advanced technology is capturing all this molecular and medical data, and how it's gonna help with precision medicine. They talk about challenges and shit, but then go on to brag about all the fancy methods they've come up with to uncover personalized info from all this big data. They even list all the damn tools they have available. But let's be real, with all this big data constantly growing, they're gonna have a shit ton of problems trying to integrate it all."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Precision medicine, also known as P4 medicine, is a new approach to individualizing medical practice. However, the challenge lies in interpreting the large and complex data sets that are generated from omics and clinical data. Big data, which is characterized by its large size, high speed, and heterogeneity, is being investigated in conjunction with precision medicine. The goal is to use various data types, from genomes to microbiomes, to drive precision medicine. Four related problems in precision medicine are patient subtyping, bio-marker discovery, drug repurposing, and personalized treatment prediction. These problems are being addressed through integrative analyses of multiple data types. Sub-typing and bio-marker discovery aim to identify sub-populations of patients and characteristic features of those sub-populations. Drug repurposing involves identifying new uses for existing drugs, while personalized treatment prediction involves deriving personalized treatments based on patient sub-typing and precise prediction of therapeutic treatment outcomes."}, {"heading": "Avalanche Of Omics Data", "text": "Fucking biomedical data capturing technologies are producing a shit ton of omics sciences data. Figure 1 shows the damn key omics data types, including fucking proteomics. This article is copyrighted, so don't even fucking think about stealing it."}, {"heading": "Genomics And Exomics.", "text": "Genomics is a fancy way of saying they're trying to capture all your genetic material. It used to take them 12 years and $3 billion to capture just one human genome, but now they can do it in just two months with the Roche GS-FLX 454. And with the Illumina HiSeq X, they can capture 16 human genomes worth of data in just three days. But don't be fooled, only a tiny percentage of your genetic material actually codes for genes. That's where exomics comes in, focusing on the smaller regions to make sequencing quicker and cheaper. They're even studying individual cells now, which has led to the discovery of mosaicism, where one person can have different genotypes in different cells. And then there's epigenomics, which studies the modifications on your genetic material that affect gene expression. It's cell-type specific and plays a role in cancer. Finally, there's transcriptomics, which measures the amount of transcribed genetic material over time. They use it to identify dysregulated genes in cancer and predict cancer outcomes."}, {"heading": "Proteomics And Interactomics.", "text": "This fucking article talks about transcriptomics and proteomics, which are two ways to study the shit that goes on in cells. Transcriptomics looks at all the RNAs that get made, while proteomics looks at the proteins that get produced after all the fucking modifications. The human proteome is way fucking bigger than the genome because of all the different ways genes can get expressed and modified. There's like over a million different fucking proteins that can be made. Scientists use mass spectrometry and other fancy-ass techniques to study these proteins and how they interact with other shit. They've used this shit to figure out important pathways and stuff."}, {"heading": "Metabolomics, Glycomics And Fluxomics.", "text": "What the fuck is a metabolite? It's just some shit that gets made or used up during chemical processes in a cell. And then there's this bullshit called metabolomics that studies all the chemical processes with these metabolites. They measure this crap with mass-spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. And then there's glycomics, which is just a fancy way of saying they study all the sugars in cells, whether they're free or in some complex molecule like glycoproteins. And don't even get me started on glycosylation, which is just some complicated way of modifying proteins with sugars. Apparently, these sugars are important for cell growth, the immune system, communication between cells, and even fucking cancer and diseases caused by microbes. And then there's fluxomics, which is just a bunch of methods that try to predict the rates of metabolic reactions in biological systems. Who the hell cares?"}, {"heading": "Phenomics And Exposomics.", "text": "Phenomics is a fancy way of measuring physical and biochemical traits of organisms as they change due to genetic mutation and environmental influences. Genome wide association studies are used to detect associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and common diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and psychiatric disorders. Exposomics encompasses all human environmental exposures, including exposure to toxic molecules, drugs, and radiation. Metagenomics aims to capture human microbiomes, which play an important role in various medical conditions. However, taking into account microbiota is challenging because there are about ten times more microbial cells than human cells."}, {"heading": "Biomedical Data Gets More Complex", "text": "The fucking complexity of biomedical data is growing in two fucking directions: in terms of the fucking number of samples and in terms of heterogeneity. As capturing technologies are becoming faster and cheaper, the fucking number of individuals for whom data is available is quickly increasing. For example, the number of available human genomes/exomes increased almost exponentially during the last decade. Nowadays, the Exome Aggregation Consortium contains 60,706 unrelated human exomes. The United Kingdom government recently announced the project to map 100,000 human genomes by 2017 and the precision medicine initiative in the US plans to map 1 million human genomes. The fucking datasets are highly heterogeneous; data from the same type can be captured with different technologies having varying coverage, bias and noise robustness."}, {"heading": "Machine Learning Techniques", "text": "Big Data is a huge pain in the ass because it's so damn large, diverse, and complex. You need fancy algorithms to extract any useful information from it. There are three types of computational techniques used to analyze Big Data: statistical, machine learning, and network-based. Machine learning is the most popular because it can integrate all sorts of biomedical data types, which is a big challenge in precision medicine. There are three types of machine learning methods: supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised. They all have their own bullshit jargon, but basically, they either use labeled or unlabeled data to find patterns and make predictions. Integrating different types of data is a real bitch, but there are some tools out there that can help."}, {"heading": "Computational Methods For Disease Sub-Typing And Bio-Marker Discovery", "text": "Sub-typing diseases is a fucking task where patients are grouped based on their genetic, clinical, and other data to get more accurate prognoses and improve treatment decisions. Cancer is one of the most studied diseases for sub-typing, and many subtypes have been identified using unsupervised clustering ML methods. These methods identify driver mutation modules for each subtype, which can be used as new targets for repurposing known drugs and their combinations. Integrative approaches that combine multiple types of molecular data provide more accurate sub-typing. iCluster is a widely used tool that has been applied to subtyping various cancers, including breast cancer and glioblastoma multiforme, and has identified novel subgroups with significantly different outcomes."}, {"heading": "The First Method That Deals With Detection Of Contradictory Signals Across Different Data Types Is Proteomics", "text": "This fucking article talks about some bullshit method called Patient Specific Data Fusion (PSDF) for analyzing gene expression and copy number variation data in prostate and breast cancer patients. It uses some statistical ML approach called Bayesian that builds a model of data by constructing conditional dependencies between data variables represented by conditional probabilities. It's fucking slow and can only handle two data types. Another method called Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) is more scalable and combines mRNA expression, DNA methylation, and microRNA expression data for cancer patients. Some other method called Network-based Stratification (NBS) uses somatic mutation data and molecular networks to stratify cancer patients into different subgroups. There are fucking challenges and open questions like determining the number of subtypes and normalizing different data types. This shit is all a bunch of fucking bullshit."}, {"heading": "Computational Methods For Drug Repurposing And Personalised Treatments", "text": "Various computational methods for drug repurposing have been proposed, including drug-based and disease-based methods. These methods use similarity-based approaches and often use either machine-learning or network-based methods in the drug inference process. Integrative methods capable of integrating various similarities from different data types containing complementary information, such as pharmacological, chemical, genetic, and clinical data, have started attracting more attention due to their ability to address the goal of precision medicine. These methods include kernel-based methods, multiple similarities collaborative matrix factorization, and drug disease repositioning. Non-coding RNAs, in particular microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, have recently started attracting attention due to their involvement in various diseases and have been proposed as potential biomarkers and drug targets. Challenges and open questions include the need for different data types to be represented in a common feature space and the choice of an appropriate similarity measure to integrate various data types."}, {"heading": "Challenges And Perspectives", "text": "The fucking biomedical data is getting more and more available, but it's a fucking challenge to deal with the \"three V\" components. Shit like high dimensionality requires computationally intensive techniques to reduce dimensions and reveal hidden substructures. Topological Data Analysis methods might be a fucking solution to this shit. Coping with the growth of Big Data over time is also a fucking challenge, but \"anytime algorithms\" that can learn from streaming data might be useful. Integrating heterogeneous data types is a fucking challenge, but MF-based methods are promising. EHR data presents numerous computational challenges that are yet to be addressed, like nosiness and incompleteness. Big data integration also opens novel opportunities in bioinformatics and other data sciences."}, {"heading": "Figure Legends", "text": "This fucking article talks about some bullshit methods for precision medicine. Basically, they use a bunch of fancy Matrix Factorization and Network-based shit to figure out what kind of drugs to give to cancer patients. They look at stuff like DNA copy number variations, mRNA expression, and methylation data to try and find biomarkers and sub-types. Some of these methods can even do both sub-typing and drug repurposing. It's all a bunch of fucking jargon, but basically they're trying to find the best fucking drugs for cancer patients based on their genetic shit."}, {"heading": "Kernel-Based Supervised", "text": "What the fuck is this shit? Basically, these fucking nerds are trying to find new uses for drugs by looking at their chemical structures and how they affect genes and proteins. They're using some fancy-ass matrix factorization bullshit to predict interactions between drugs and targets or diseases. Like, who the fuck cares? Just give people the damn drugs and hope they work. These scientists need to get a fucking life and stop wasting their time with this useless crap."}, {"heading": "Kolmogorov-Smirnov Unsupervised", "text": "This fucking text talks about some bullshit called \"network completion\" and \"drug repurposing\" which apparently involves integrating a bunch of fucking networks like drug-target, drug-disease, and disease-target. Then there's some shit about \"inference of drug-miRAN network\" which involves cancer-related miRNA target gene expression and transcriptional responses to drug compounds. And don't even get me started on this \"lncRNA-disease network\" and \"disease causing lncRNA prioritisation\" crap. Basically, they're trying to prioritize some fucking lncRNA bullshit by integrating a bunch of associations and expression data. It's all just a bunch of fucking network-based unsupervised bullshit."}, {"heading": "Database", "text": "This fucking text is a goddamn list of resources for studying human genes and shit. It includes links to over 59,000 genes, 487,000 gene annotations, and 5,000 epigenetic modifications. There's also a bunch of bullshit about gene expression, protein interactions, metabolic pathways, and even fucking toxins and food additives. Basically, it's a fucking goldmine for any science nerd who wants to dive deep into the intricacies of human biology."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Drug repurposing and integrating biomedical data is a fucking mess. There are a shit ton of challenges and open questions that need to be addressed. There are different approaches to drug repurposing, like drug-based or disease-based, and they use different techniques like similarity measures and machine learning. Integrative methods that combine different types of data like pharmacological, chemical, genetic, and clinical data are gaining attention, but there are still problems with transforming data, choosing the right similarity measures, dealing with data growth, and addressing data heterogeneity. There are also new types of data like exposomic and metagenomic data and Electronic Health Records that need to be analyzed. Future directions involve using topological data analysis methods and finding better ways to mine time series measurements. Overcoming these challenges will help with precision medicine and bioinformatics, which will lead to better disease understanding and personalized treatment approaches."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{title,\n  title={Revolutionizing Precision Medicine through Integrative Big Data Analysis},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}\n\n@article{genomics,\n  title={Genomics And Exomics},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}\n\n@article{proteomics,\n  title={Proteomics And Interactomics},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}\n\n@article{metabolomics,\n  title={Metabolomics, Glycomics And Fluxomics},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}\n\n@article{phenomics,\n  title={Phenomics And Exposomics},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}\n\n@article{machinelearning,\n  title={Machine Learning Techniques},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}\n\n@article{subtyping,\n  title={Computational Methods For Disease Sub-Typing And Bio-Marker Discovery},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}\n\n@article{drugrepurposing,\n  title={Computational Methods For Drug Repurposing And Personalised Treatments},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}\n\n@article{challenges,\n  title={Challenges And Perspectives},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}\n\n@article{kernel,\n  title={Kernel-Based Supervised},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}\n\n@article{kolmogorov,\n  title={Kolmogorov-Smirnov Unsupervised},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}\n\n@article{database,\n  title={Database},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}\n\n@article{conclusion,\n  title={Conclusion},\n  author={Unknown},\n  journal={Unknown},\n  year={Unknown}\n}"}]
