It involves taking into account individual variability in prevention and treatment strategies. However, the challenge lies in analyzing and interpreting the large and complex datasets generated by omics and clinical data sets. Big data, characterized by volume, velocity, and variety, is a broad term for such datasets. The precision medicine concept is being jointly investigated with big data to address the increasing gap between generating and analyzing biomedical data. Four related problems in precision medicine are patient subtyping, biomarker discovery, drug repurposing, and personalized treatment prediction.

Genomics focuses on capturing whole genomes, with modern next-generation sequencers capable of producing up to 16 human genomes worth of data per three-day run. Exomics, a subset of genomics, focuses on smaller regions of DNA called exons. Sequencing of individual cells has provided novel insights into human biology and diseases, including the concept of mosaicism. Epigenomics studies the complete set of epigenetic modifications of the genetic material of a cell, which affect gene expression and play a major role in gene regulation. Transcriptomics measures the amount of transcribed genetic material over time and is used to identify dysregulated genes in cancer, predict possible drug targets, and cancer outcomes."}, {"heading": "Proteomics And Interactomics.", "text": "Proteomics is the study of proteins produced after post-translational modifications, while transcriptomics considers all transcribed RNAs. The human proteome is much larger than the human genome due to alternative promoters, splicing, and mRNA editing. With over 300 types of post-translational modifications, the number of resulting proteins is estimated to be over 1,800,000. Mass spectrometry experiments are used for high-throughput capture of protein sequences, while yeast-two-hybrid and affinity-captured coupled with mass spectrometry are used for capturing interactions amongst proteins or between proteins and other molecules.

Trainees exposed to an 8-week kitchen-based nutrition education course were 82% more likely to satisfy intake of fruits, vegetables, and legumes, compared with medical trainees taking part in traditional nutrition education. Similarly, hands-on culinary medicine education was associated with a onethird and more than 2-fold higher daily consumption of fruits and vegetables, respectively. These results, in combination with significant positive associations of the programming with more than 20 total competencies in lifestyle medicine counseling, suggest that teaching kitchen-based nutrition and culinary education is associated with a higher intake of Mediterranean dietary components and knowledge of cardiovascular disease prevention among medical trainees.\nOur findings fit into a larger context of evidence regarding the utility of nutrition-related training among medical trainees. Our results are consistent with similar previous studies suggesting that participation in nutrition-centered courses augments trainees' confidence in dietary counseling. For example, Conroy et al 25 observed that nearly three-fourths of medical students participating in a new preventive medicine and nutrition didactic course at Harvard medical school reported improvements in personal diets following the course. This study also found that students reported significant reductions in saturated fat consumption, one important dietary modification that can lower serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and, thus, reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. 25 Likewise, even exposure to online nutrition lectures among medical trainees has been noted to improve knowledge and case-based management of diet for patients. 31 These data not only underline the value of incorporating nutrition education across academic medical centers, but also highlight the novelty of our current study because this study characterized the role of kitchen-based nutrition education in medical training.\nAs discussed earlier, the Mediterranean diet has been robustly associated with not only reduced manifestation, but also progression of cardiovascular disease in a consistent fashion. [15][16][17][18][19][20]32 Three cited barriers to adopting the Mediterranean diet are limited knowledge, lack of cooking skills, and time commitment. 33 CHOP-MT has previously demonstrated that culinary medicine education is associated with a higher overall consumption of Mediterranean diet foods in medical trainees, particularly mediated through modified consumption of 7 key food categories: olive oil, fruit, vegetables, legumes, fish, meat, and whole grains. 22 Considering the consistency and replicability of these findings across 32 sites, structured, kitchen-based nutrition education modules may overcome prevalent (eg, limited knowledge and lack of cooking skills) as well as seeming (eg, time commitment) barriers to adopting a Mediterranean diet.\nDespite the central pathophysiological as well as the preventive role of diet in cardiovascular disease, nutrition education teaching and infrastructure is lacking. According to a national survey published in Academic Medicine, medical students received a mere 19.6 hours of nutrition training throughout all 4 years of medical school. 23 Likewise, more than 50% of medical students report \"inadequate\" knowledge of nutrition. 34 Through the CHOP-MT series, culinary medicine curricula have been consistently associated with a higher proficiency and competency in lifestyle medicine counseling. 22 These  relationships have a high probability of benefiting future patients because previous research has shown a positive association between physician and patient preventive health behaviors. 35,36 Given that kitchen-based nutrition education, through the described curriculum, has already been implemented over 30 sites across the United States, our findings may serve as a platform for broader implementation of nutrition training in medical school.\nIn addition to helping prevent cardiovascular disease, adherence to the Mediterranean diet may also help reduce the incidence of other major chronic diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer disease, and chronic kidney disease. In a meta-analysis that includes predominantly observational data, high adherence to a Mediterranean diet was significantly associated with a 14% lower risk of overall cancer mortality, and the most consistent protective associations were observed for colorectal and breast cancer. 37 Additionally, strong inverse associations of individual Mediterranean diet components, including whole grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and fish, with cancer incidence and mortality have also been observed. [38][39][40][41] Much of the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet may be driven by the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and endothelial-protective properties of ingested foods. 37 Minimization of vascular injury via Mediterranean diet adherence may particularly help lower the risk of chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer's dementia because vascular dysregulation has been noted to be one of the first insults in the development of both diseases. 42,43 In a prospective study including more than 6 years of follow-up among a diverse cohort of 60-year old men and women, higher Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with a 17% and 12% lower risk of chronic kidney disease incidence and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, respectively. 44 Likewise, high Mediterranean diet adherence is prospectively associated with fewer structural and functional brain changes suggestive of Alzheimer's dementia, as measured by positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, among individuals as young as 30 years of age. 45,46 These results in total suggest that dietary patterns rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains are an important component to chronic disease prevention and may help facilitate the likelihood of healthy aging.\nThis study has several important strengths. The multisite design afforded a unique opportunity to assess Mediterranean diet intake, one important protective factor for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, in a large and diverse population. Likewise, to our knowledge, CHOP-MT is the first study to assess kitchen-based nutrition education as an exposure variable and the role it holds in medical trainee lifestyle medicine attitudes and counseling.\nLimitations of our study are also important to contemplate. Although training is part of the implementation at additional sites, the programming is taught by a variety of physicians, chefs, and dietitians, thus raising the potential for operator bias. Measures of fidelity used to reduce operator bias included standardized training of CHOP curriculum instructors, including the distribution of curriculum manuals, curriculum guides, and case studies to ensure that the CHOP curriculum exposure remained consistent, regardless of the class instructor. CHOP curriculum classes were also randomly audited by CHOP committee members to assess the standardization of all modules. Two other limitations to note are that (1) this study was unable to assess the longitudinal relationship between culinary medicine, and Mediterranean diet intake and CHOP curriculum exposure, and (2) propensity analysis may not have fully compensated for the potential situation in which individuals participating in CHOP had systematic differences in dietary patterns compared with those not participating in CHOP, regardless of the curriculum exposure. These limitations will be addressed in subsequent research by administering pre-kitchen-based and post-kitchen-based nutrition education surveys during each year of medical training among CHOP study participants, with each participant serving as his/her own control. In this way, potential selection bias will be decreased, and also observe important prospective relationships between CHOP education and dietary habits could be studied. Furthermore, the use of food frequency questionnaires after an educational exposure may bias parameter estimates in favor of the exposure or desired information. Yet this phenomenon may not be a true bias and may instead rather simply serve as a proxy of effectiveness of the educational exposure. Finally, whereas the CHOP curriculum is based on the Mediterranean diet, a dietary pattern that has consistently shown to have cardioprotective benefit, there are other dietary patterns that may be beneficial to consider with respect to cardiovascular disease prevention. Notably, adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and vegetarian dietary patterns also reduce cardiovascular disease risk. 47,48 Future studies that assess the key differences among these dietary patterns with respect to their relationship to cardiometabolic health and lifestyle medicine are undoubtedly necessary.\nThe current study demonstrates that kitchen-based nutrition education, when compared with traditional nutrition coursework, is associated with a higher likelihood of Mediterranean diet intake and lifestyle medicine counseling competence in medical trainees enrolled at 32 sites across the United States. Although these results are encouraging, there remain practical challenges associated with implementing culinary medicine programs more broadly, including the dearth of kitchen space at medical schools and competing educational topics in an already exhaustive medical school curriculum schedule. There are future opportunities for medical board examiners to add specific nutritional topics to board exams in an effort to incentivize incorporation of nutrition education standards across medical institutions and hospitals. In summary, our results provide a platform for nutrition education reform in American medical schools, suggesting that integrating nutrition didactics with hands-on cooking modules in a kitchen setting provides an optimized design to improve medical trainee diets as well as their clinical dietary counseling skills."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{hood2011predictive,\n  title={Predictive, personalized, preventive, participatory (p4) cancer medicine},\n  author={Hood, L and Friend, SH},\n  journal={Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology},\n  year={2011}\n}\n\n@article{mirnezami2012preparing,\n  title={Preparing for precision medicine},\n  author={Mirnezami, R and Nicholson, J and Darzi, A},\n  journal={New England Journal of Medicine},\n  year={2012}\n}\n\n@article{smits1995long,\n  title={Long-term results of solid organ transplantation. report from the eurotransplant international foundation},\n  author={Smits, J and De Meester, J and Persijn, G and Claas, F and Vanrenterghem, Y},\n  journal={Clinical Transplants},\n  year={1995}\n}\n\n@article{takemoto1992survival,\n  title={Survival of nationally shared, hla-matched kidney transplants from cadaveric donors},\n  author={Takemoto, S and Terasaki, P I and Cecka, J M and Cho, Y W and Gjertson, D W},\n  journal={New England Journal of Medicine},\n  year={1992}\n}\n\n@article{thorogood1990effect,\n  title={The effect of hla matching on kidney graft survival in separate posttransplantation intervals},\n  author={Thorogood, J},\n  journal={Transplantation},\n  year={1990}\n}\n\n@article{mitsuishi1992hla,\n  title={HLA matching effect on five-year graft survival and half-life in the cyclosporine era},\n  author={Mitsuishi, Y and Terasaki, P},\n  journal={Kidney International.
