These programs are epigenetically fixed and are passed down to all daughter HSCs on self-renewal. HSCs within each subset are similar in their self-renewal and differentiation behaviors, and three subsets can be distinguished based on their differentiation capacity: myeloid-biased, balanced, and lymphoid-biased HSCs. The relative number of HSC subsets is developmentally regulated, with lymphoid-biased HSCs found predominantly early in an organism's life and myeloid-biased HSCs accumulating in aged mice and humans. This discovery has implications for HSC aging and regenerative medicine, and may apply to other adult tissue stem cells."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been successfully used to treat and cure patients, making them a paradigm for regenerative medicine. However, recent discoveries have shown that the biology of HSCs is not well understood, and their application as clinical tools is not standardized. It has been discovered that the HSC compartment consists of distinct and separable subsets of HSCs with largely preprogrammed differentiation and self-renewal behaviors. The adult HSC compartment consists of a limited number of distinct subsets of HSCs, each with its own epigenetically fixed differentiation and self-renewal program. This means that the hematopoietic system is not sustained by a single type of HSC with flexible behavior, but rather a mixture of several types of HSCs. Each subset of HSCs has different self-renewal capacity, distinct differentiation programs, and probably different requirements for proliferation. This has consequences for the understanding of the biology of HSCs, and new concepts about the mechanisms that control HSC self-renewal and differentiation are needed."}, {"heading": "A Brief History Of Stochastic, Deterministic, And Instructive Models Of Hsc Heterogeneity", "text": "The article discusses the historical understanding of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and how recent research has challenged previous assumptions. The traditional view was that all HSCs were born with the same proliferation and differentiation capacity, resulting in a homogeneous population of cells. However, early signs of heterogeneity were observed through CFU assays, which led to the formulation of important concepts that inform our thinking to this day. The article also discusses the Generation Age Hypothesis and the idea that all stem cell decisions were instructed by extrinsic signals. The article concludes by suggesting that the heterogeneity of HSCs may hold the key to ex vivo expansion and that different subsets of HSCs may require distinct conditions for optimal expansion."}, {"heading": "Limited Heterogeneity Of The Hsc Compartment", "text": "The paper discusses the heterogeneity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in various species. The differentiation and self-renewal capacity of HSCs were measured by transplanting limiting numbers of HSCs or clonally marked HSCs into ablated hosts. The experiments revealed extensive heterogeneity in the HSC compartment, with HSCs differing in self-renewal capacity, differentiation potential, and repopulation kinetics. Mathematical analysis showed that all HSCs can be grouped into maximally 16 of 54 possible subsets based on similarities of the repopulation kinetics. These HSC subsets are stable throughout the lifespan of the organisms, although the number of HSCs in the different groups changes with age. The generation of HSC diversity must be initiated during the development of the hematopoietic system."}, {"heading": "Finite Life Span Of All Hscs", "text": "The article discusses the lifespan of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clones and their intrinsic mechanisms for controlling it. Each HSC clone eventually stops generating mature cells, and the lifespan of a clone is determined by the self-renewal capacity of the mother HSC and the differentiation capacity of each HSC in the clone. Daughter HSCs within a clone share the same lifespan, suggesting an intrinsic program that limits their lifespan. The mechanisms that synchronize HSCs and assure inheritance of their programs to daughter HSCs remain unknown. The article suggests that clonal heterogeneity is probably generated in early development, and epigenetic mechanisms may be responsible for the generation and maintenance of HSC heterogeneity. The article also discusses various intrinsic and extrinsic molecules that contribute to the self-renewal of HSCs."}, {"heading": "Programmed Lineage Potential Of Hscs", "text": "The differentiation and self-renewal capacities of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are programmed, and HSCs can be divided into three subsets based on their differentiation potential. These subsets are balanced (Bala), myeloid-biased (My-bi), and lymphoid-biased (Ly-bi) HSCs. All three subsets have extensive self-renewal capacity, but their differentiation potential is stably inherited through many rounds of self-renewal. My-bi HSCs produce normal levels of myeloid cells but have an attenuated ability to generate lymphocytes, while Ly-bi HSCs generate normal levels of lymphoid but only low levels of myeloid progenitors. The differentiation program is epigenetically fixed on the level of the HSCs. The ability to prospectively enrich the different HSC subsets has greatly facilitated the characterization of these rare cells, but refined purification schemes are needed to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms that endow HSCs with their distinct, stable differentiation and self-renewal capacity."}, {"heading": "Hsc Composition Predicted By Myeloid Skewed Blood", "text": "The differentiation programs of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have a more immediate effect on the composition of mature cells in the periphery than previously thought. As mice age, their blood turns distinctly myeloid, with the myeloid bias correlating with the status of the HSC compartment. In young mice, Ly-bi HSCs compose the majority of HSCs in both strains of mice, but with aging, My-bi HSCs increase and Ly-bi HSCs are lost. In aged D2 mice, almost 80% of the HSC compartment consists of My-bi HSCs, and most animals show a corresponding increase of myeloid cells in blood. In contrast, My-bi HSCs in aged B6 mice do not compose more than 40% of the HSC compartment, and the number of My-bi HSCs appears to be variable in different animals. The composition of the HSC compartment is probably reflected by the composition of the mature cell compartment."}, {"heading": "Aging Of The Hsc Compartment", "text": "The debate on whether hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) age has been ongoing. HSCs isolated from aged individuals show many differences to HSCs isolated from young individuals. However, most of the \"aged\" behavior of HSCs can be explained by an accumulation of My-bi HSCs in the aged HSC compartment of both mice and humans. My-bi HSCs isolated from either young or aged sources show a delayed onset of repopulation and a differentiation program skewed toward the myeloid lineages. CD150 \u03e9 cells from aged mice have less self-renewal capacity and home less efficiently to BM than CD150 \u03e9 cells isolated from young animals. These low repopulating HSCs/progenitors exist in both young and aged environments but are enriched in aged mice. The existing data suggest that the aging of the organism has at best a modest effect on the behavior of individual HSCs. However, age does affect the composition of the HSC compartment because Ly-bi HSCs are lost."}, {"heading": "Hsc \"Aging,\" A Paradigm For Other Adult Stem Cells?", "text": "The text discusses the idea that adult stem cells in various tissues are not uniform and that changes in the differentiation programs of stem cells in young and old organisms have been observed. The author suggests that aging in multiple organs may be linked to a shift in the stem cell compartment rather than the aging of the stem cells themselves. This concept of stem cell heterogeneity could lead to new approaches to prevent and repair age-related stem cell deficiencies. The paper concludes with a summary of evidence for stem cell heterogeneity in adult tissues."}, {"heading": "Mesenchymal Stem Cells", "text": "The text discusses the role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the development of fibroblasts, skeletal muscle cells, bone, and cartilage. It highlights that MSCs from aged individuals show decreased osteoblast and fibroblast development, but increased adipogenesis. The study by Maijenburg et al. revealed that the MSC compartment can be divided into three distinct subpopulations, with CD271 Bright MSCs having a strong potential for generating fibroblasts. However, this population is depleted in elderly humans, leading to a shift in the clonal composition of the MSC compartment and a change in the output of differentiated progeny. The text concludes that MSCs mirror hematopoietic stem cell heterogeneity and aging."}, {"heading": "Cardiac Stem Cells", "text": "The existence of cardiac stem cells is still a topic of debate. However, studies have identified a multipotent stem cell that can generate cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Evidence suggests that cardiac stem cells are active in the elderly, but not as efficient as in young humans. It has been found that some populations of cardiac stem cells exist early in development but not in adults, indicating that the composition of the stem cell compartment is developmentally regulated and heterogeneous."}, {"heading": "Neural Stem Cells", "text": "Neural stem cells are cells that can produce all types of neurons and glia and can renew themselves. Although neurogenesis continues throughout adulthood, the rate of new neuron production decreases as the animal ages. In aged mice, neural stem cells tend to produce more astrocytes than neurons compared to younger mice. It is unclear whether neural stem cells are made up of different subsets and whether the composition of these subsets changes with age. Clonal analysis can now be used to investigate this. The brain is now able to undergo clonal analysis, which can help to answer these questions."}, {"heading": "Speculations About Implications For Regenerative Medicine", "text": "The paper discusses the potential use of different subsets of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in regenerative medicine. The My-bi HSCs could be used to treat myelopenia by selectively expanding them through exposure to low levels of TGF-\u2424. This would lead to durable production of myeloid cells with a lower probability of GVHD due to the low levels of lymphocytes produced. On the other hand, Ly-bi HSCs could be used to treat lymphopenia and age-related immune defects. The loss of Ly-bi HSCs in the aged HSC compartment contributes to the attenuated immunity found in many elderly, resulting in decreased immune surveillance and a corresponding increase in cancers. Restoring youthful Ly-bi HSCs is likely to rejuvenate the immune system in the elderly. Understanding the biology of different subsets of HSCs could delay or prevent the loss of youthful HSCs in situ."}, {"heading": "Embryonic Or Induced", "text": "The promise of regenerative medicine lies in the ability to use embryonic stem (ES) cells or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells as sources for all types of tissue stem cells. However, difficulties in differentiating these pluripotent stem cells into equivalents of adult tissue stem cells that can engraft damaged tissues have hindered their application. Attempts to generate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from ES and iPS cells have been challenging, with even ES cell-derived HSCs heavily skewed towards the myeloid lineage. It is possible that ES/iPS cultures preferentially generate certain stem cell subsets and not others, and improving in vitro conditions could lead to the generation of more complete stem cell populations. Understanding the in vivo conditions that lead to the emergence of stem cell subsets during development could also lead to improved methods for generating adult stem cells."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Network pharmacology is becoming a cutting-edge research field in current drug discovery and drug development thanks to rapid progress in systems biology, network biology, and chemical biology. By integrating reductionist and systems approaches as well as computational and experimental methods, network pharmacology has great potential to act as the next generation mode of drug research. Network pharmacology studies emphasize the paradigm shift from \"one target, one drug\" to \"network target, multicomponent therapeutics, \" highlighting a holistic thinking also shared by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In TCM, the perspective of holism has long been central to herbal treatments of various diseases. Characterized by holistic theory and rich experience in multicomponent therapeutics, TCM herbal formulae offer bright prospects for the control of complex diseases in a systematic manner. Thus, introducing network pharmacology in TCM will provide novel methodologies and new opportunities for discovering bioactive ingredients and endogenous/exogenous biomarkers, revealing mechanisms of action and exploring scientific evidence of numerous herbs and herbal formulae in TCM on the basis of complex biological systems of human body. Moreover, the integration of TCM and network pharmacology can greatly promote the progress of network pharmacology as well.\nHere, we have grouped together 27 papers in this burgeoning field, put forward for publication in this special issue on TCM network pharmacology.\nIn the special issue, we have firstly published four concise reviews or perspectives across the two fields between TCM and network pharmacology. The topics range from the research paradigm of network pharmacology based on TCM theory and practice, the available databases and computational tools in TCM network pharmacology, to the applications of network pharmacology in TCM. These papers highlighted some specific themes, such as the concept of network target, mechanisms of TCM herbal formulae, and target identification of herbal active ingredients. For example, a review article provided a perspective regarding TCM-based network pharmacology and its use in multiple compound drug discovery, by following an analysis of the merged networks of differentially expressed genes in rheumatoid arthritis-cold pattern and protein targets related to Fu Zi, Xi Xin and Gui Zhi. Three other review articles comprehensively addressed the origin and development of TCM network pharmacology, the definitions of basic network concepts, the computational tools and data sources regarding TCM network pharmacology, and the significance and approaches of network pharmacology in the TCM field, as well as the target identification methods of herbal active ingredients and the use of ligand-protein networks.\nA remarkable feature of TCM is the use of herbal formulae. Understanding the mechanisms of action and combinatorial rules of herbal formulae is of great significance in TCM modernization and is also one of the important steps in modern drug discovery. The emerging TCM network pharmacology offers a unique opportunity to explore systematically not only the molecular complexity of an herbal formula, but also the molecular relationships between an herbal 2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine formula and complex diseases. A practical strategy of TCM network pharmacology is the combined use of network-based computational predictions and experimental validations. In this special issue, we have published 11 interesting research papers covering 10 classic herbal formulae by employing network-based approaches and omics-based experimental studies. For example, two research papers established an integrative platform of TCM network pharmacology on the basis of the concept of \"network target, multicomponent therapeutics, \" and then applied this platform in the identification of active compounds and mechanisms of action of an herbal formula Qing-Luo-Yin for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as Ge-Gen-Qin-Lian decoction recorded in \"Shang-Han-Lun\" for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Moreover, network analysis and omics technologies including genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic studies are always integrated together to understand the molecular actions exerted by herbal formulae at a systematic level. In the special issue, four papers addressed the metabolomic analysis for determining the effects of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis, the metabolomic analysis for She-Xiang-Bao-Xin pill in treating myocardial infarction in rats, the proteomic analysis for determining the possible proteomic network associated with the antiarthritic effects of Qing-Fu-Guan-Jie-Shu in collagen-induced arthritis rats, and the experimental study of the protective effect of Xiao-Xu-Ming decoction in a rat model of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. It is known that identifying the target proteins and combinatorial rules of active ingredients in herbal formulae remains to be a difficult issue. There are six papers to address such an issue from the network point of view by using bioinformatics analysis and experiments, for example, the mechanism of antirheumatic actions of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang by network analysis, the molecular mechanism of Shu-Feng-Jie-Du formula by a module analysis, drug-target network of Yuan-Hu-Zhi-Tong prescription, the pharmacological mechanisms of Wu-Tou-Tang, and the mechanism of cell apoptosis induced by Fu-Zheng-Hua-Yu tablet.\nHerbal active ingredients have long been viewed as a rich source of therapeutic leads in drug discovery. Network pharmacology is expected to be a new strategy and powerful tool to find the bioactive compounds as well as their potential molecular targets from numerous herbs or herbal formulae. For herbal active ingredients, there are eight papers published in this special issue with the efforts to study herbal active ingredients by network pharmacology approaches. For example, a paper predicted the target network of vitexicarpin and experimentally validated the molecular network account for its antiangiogenic activities. A paper proposed a computational method to identify the effective herbal components and mechanisms of action. A paper revealed a pharmacological signaling pathway network of baicalin in the treatment of ischaemia-reperfusion in mice. Three other papers addressed the molecular mechanisms of herbal active ingredients with the help of omics technologies, including the metabolomic analysis of genipin in rats and identification of metabolites by LC/MS, the neuroprotective effects of hydroxysafflor yellow A via the NF-kappaB pathway by NMR-based metabonomics, and expression profiling and proteomic analysis of JIN Chinese herbal formula in lung carcinoma H460 xenografts. Lastly, two experimental studies are published on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition induction of shikonin in skin wound healing and capsaicininduced cancer cell apoptosis through ER stress.\nUncovering the scientific basis of herbal traditional properties especially the molecular association between herbal formulae and TCM syndrome (ZHENG) is absolutely critical to preserve and develop TCM. Four papers in this special issue focus on the traditional properties of TCM. A paper identified the network-based biomarkers for the Cold Coagulation Blood Stasis Syndrome and showed the therapeutic effects of Shao-Fu-Zhu-Yu decoction in rats. To identify potent synergistic combinations in herbal formulae, a paper developed an interesting Feedback System Control Scheme to optimize combinations of flavonoids derived from Astragali Radix. As the potential adverse effects of herbs have limited their clinical applications, a paper proposed a networkbased computational model to predict the safety of herbs through a comparative analysis of withdrawn drugs. Based on combining formula network, chemical space, and metabolic space, a paper analyzed the properties of the incompatible herbal pairs associated with the traditional rule termed \"eighteen antagonisms and nineteen mutual inhibitors\" in herbal formulae.\nIn summary, TCM network pharmacology is a new interdisciplinary frontier in both ancient TCM and modern drug discovery and development fields, which represents valuable interactions and exchanges between traditional Chinese medicine and those of network, pharmacological, biomedical and computational sciences. This special issue provides a high-profile venue for dissemination of significant scientific findings in TCM network pharmacology. It is just the beginning. We encourage researchers in TCM and related fields to support the development of this novel and promising direction."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{little2002history,\n  title={History of haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation},\n  author={Little, M T and Storb, R},\n  journal={Nat Rev Cancer},\n  year={2002}\n}\n\n@article{muller2002deterministic,\n  title={Deterministic regulation of hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation},\n  author={Muller-Sieburg, C E and Cho, R H and Thoman, M and Adkins, B and Sieburg, H B},\n  journal={Blood},\n  year={2002}\n}\n\n@article{muller2004myeloid,\n  title={Myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem cells have extensive self-renewal capacity but generate diminished lymphoid progeny with impaired IL-7 responsiveness},\n  author={Muller-Sieburg, C E and Cho, R H and Karlsson, L and Huang, J-F and Sieburg, H B},\n  journal={Blood},\n  year={2004}\n}\n\n@article{sieburg2006hematopoietic,\n  title={The hematopoietic stem compartment consists of a limited number of discrete stem cell subsets},\n  author={Sieburg, H B and Cho, R H and Dykstra, B and Uchida, N and Eaves, C J and Muller-Sieburg, C E},\n  journal={Blood},\n  year={2006}\n}\n\n@article{challen2010distinct,\n  title={Distinct hematopoietic stem cell subtypes are differentially regulated by TGF-beta1},\n  author={Challen, G A and Boles, N C and Chambers, S M and Goodell, M A},\n  journal={Cell Stem Cell},\n  year={2010}\n}\n\n@article{beerman2010functionally,\n  title={Functionally distinct hematopoietic stem cells modulate hematopoietic lineage potential during aging by a mechanism of clonal expansion},\n  author={Beerman, I and Bhattacharya, D and Zandi, S},\n  journal={Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A},\n  year={2010}\n}\n\n@article{dykstra2007long,\n  title={Long-term propagation of distinct hematopoietic differentiation programs in vivo},\n  author={Dykstra, B and Kent, D and Bowie, M},\n  journal={Cell Stem Cell},\n  year={2007}\n}\n\n@article{morita2010heterogeneity,\n  title={Heterogeneity and hierarchy within the most primitive hematopoietic stem cell compartment},\n  author={Morita, Y and Ema, H and Nakauchi, H},\n  journal={J Exp Med},\n  year={2010}\n}\n\n@article{pang2011human,\n  title={Human bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells are increased in frequency and myeloid-biased with age},\n  author={Pang, W W and Price, E A and Sahoo, D},\n  journal={Proc Natl Acad Sci},\n  year={2011}\n}\n\n@article{till1964stochastic,\n  title={A stochastic model of stem cell proliferation, based on the growth of spleen colony-forming cells},\n  author={Till, J E and McCulloch, E A and Siminovitch, L},\n  journal={Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A},\n  year={1964}\n}\n\n@article{starnes2011regulatory,\n  title={Regulatory circuitries coordinated by transcription factors and micro-RNAs at the cornerstone of hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation},\n  author={Starnes, L M and Sorrentino, A},\n  journal={Curr Stem Cell Res Ther},\n  year={2011}\n}\n\n@article{freitas2000population,\n  title={Population biology of lymphocytes: the flight for survival},\n  author={Freitas, A A and Rocha, B},\n  journal={Annu Rev Immunol},\n  year={2000}\n}\n\n@article{tagliani2011coordinate,\n  title={Coordinate regulation of tissue macrophage and dendritic cell population dynamics by CSF-1},\n  author={Tagliani, E and Shi, C and Nancy, P and Tay, C S and Pamer, E G and Erlebacher, A},\n  journal={J Exp Med},\n  year={2011}\n}"}]
