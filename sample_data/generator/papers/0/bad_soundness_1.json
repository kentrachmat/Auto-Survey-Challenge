It involves taking into account individual variability in prevention and treatment strategies. However, the challenge lies in analyzing and interpreting the large and complex datasets generated by omics and clinical data sets. Big data, characterized by volume, velocity, and variety, is a broad term for such datasets. The precision medicine concept is being jointly investigated with big data to address the increasing gap between generating and analyzing biomedical data. Four related problems in precision medicine are patient subtyping, biomarker discovery, drug repurposing, and personalized treatment prediction. This paper provides an overview of available methods for analyzing large and diverse biomedical data and the successes and limitations of big data approaches in precision medicine."}, {"heading": "Avalanche Of Omics Data", "text": "The text discusses the growing amount of biomedical data being produced by omics sciences due to advancements in data capturing technologies.

Genomics focuses on capturing whole genomes, with modern next-generation sequencers capable of producing up to 16 human genomes worth of data per three-day run. Exomics, a subset of genomics, focuses on smaller regions of DNA called exons. Sequencing of individual cells has provided novel insights into human biology and diseases, including the concept of mosaicism. Epigenomics studies the complete set of epigenetic modifications of the genetic material of a cell, which affect gene expression and play a major role in gene regulation. Transcriptomics measures the amount of transcribed genetic material over time and is used to identify dysregulated genes in cancer, predict possible drug targets, and cancer outcomes."}, {"heading": "Proteomics And Interactomics.", "text": "Proteomics is the study of proteins produced after post-translational modifications, while transcriptomics considers all transcribed RNAs. The human proteome is much larger than the human genome due to alternative promoters, splicing, and mRNA editing. With over 300 types of post-translational modifications, the number of resulting proteins is estimated to be over 1,800,000. Mass spectrometry experiments are used for high-throughput capture of protein sequences, while yeast-two-hybrid and affinity-captured coupled with mass spectrometry are used for capturing interactions amongst proteins or between proteins and other molecules. Interactomes and protein-protein interactions are used to identify evolutionarily conserved pathways, complexes, and functional orthologs."}, {"heading": "Metabolomics, Glycomics And Fluxomics.", "text": "Metabolomics is the study of all chemical processes involving metabolites, which are substances produced or consumed during metabolism. This field measures metabolic profiles using mass-spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. Glycomics is a branch of metabolomics that studies glycomes, which are the sets of all sugars in cells, including those in complex molecules such as glycoproteins. Glycosylation is the most complex post-translational modification of proteins, and glycans are involved in cell growth and development, the immune system, cell-to-cell communication, and diseases such as cancer and microbial diseases. Fluxomics is a range of methods that attempt to identify or predict the rates of metabolic reactions in biological systems."}, {"heading": "Phenomics And Exposomics.", "text": "Phenomics is a field of biology that measures physical and biochemical traits of organisms as they change in response to genetic mutation and environmental influences. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are commonly used to detect associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and common diseases. Exposomics encompasses all human environmental exposures from conception onwards, including exposure to toxic molecules, drugs, and radiation. Metagenomics aims to capture human microbiomes, which play an important role in various medical conditions. However, taking into account microbiota is challenging due to the large number of microbial cells in the human microbiome."}, {"heading": "Biomedical Data Gets More Complex", "text": "The complexity of biomedical data is increasing in terms of the number of samples and heterogeneity. The number of available human genomes/exomes has increased exponentially in the last decade due to faster and cheaper capturing technologies. The increasing number of genome samples will also lead to an increase in variations in terms of genome quality. Moreover, an increasing number of samples is captured for the same individual, and the time span of available samples is increasing. The number of different biological entities for which data can be collected is also increasing, leading to highly heterogeneous datasets. The collected data are so large that even basic data management is becoming challenging."}, {"heading": "Machine Learning Techniques", "text": "The article discusses the challenges of analyzing Big Data in precision medicine and the need for efficient algorithms to extract knowledge from them. The computational techniques used for analyzing Big Data are based on statistical, machine learning (ML), or network-based (NB) methods. ML methods are particularly useful for data integration due to their ability to collectively mine large-scale, diverse, and heterogeneous biomedical data types.

Cancer is one of the most studied diseases by sub-typing, with many molecular subtypes identified using unsupervised clustering ML methods. Integrative approaches that combine multiple types of molecular data provide more accurate sub-typing. iCluster is an unsupervised learning framework that can simultaneously perform clustering, data integration, feature selection, and dimension reduction of multiple data types. It has been applied for subtyping various cancers, including breast cancer and glioblastoma multiforme, and has identified novel subgroups with statistically different clinical outcomes. Integrative analysis is more powerful than analyzing single data types in characterizing, classifying, and predicting clinical outcomes of cancer patients."}, {"heading": "The First Method That Deals With Detection Of Contradictory Signals Across Different Data Types Is Proteomics", "text": "The article discusses various methods for integrating different types of data to identify subtypes of cancer patients. These methods include Patient Specific Data Fusion (PSDF), iCluster, Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE), Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), and Network-based Stratification (NBS). PSDF and iCluster use Bayesian approaches to integrate gene expression and copy number variation data, while JIVE and NBS incorporate molecular networks to improve patient clustering. SNF is a network-based method that fuses patient similarity networks constructed from different data types.
