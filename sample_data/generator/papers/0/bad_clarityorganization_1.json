Cancer is one of the most studied diseases by sub-typing, with many molecular subtypes identified using unsupervised clustering ML methods. Integrative approaches that combine multiple types of molecular data provide more accurate sub-typing. iCluster is an unsupervised learning framework that can simultaneously perform clustering, data integration, feature selection, and dimension reduction of multiple data types.
