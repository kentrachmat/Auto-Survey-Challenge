[{"heading": "Title", "text": "\"The Emergence of the Periphrastic Perfect Tense in West Germanic Languages of the Continent\""}, {"heading": "Abstract", "text": "This article argues that periphrastic perfect-tense constructions in Dutch developed from copular-like constructions with HAVE and BE, thanks to the introduction of two morphological rules. The first rule allowed for the derivation of verbal participles from adjectival participles, leading to periphrastic perfect-tense constructions with transitive and mutative intransitive verbs. Later, this rule was replaced by a rule that derives verbal participles from verbal stems, allowing for the spread of the periphrastic perfect tense to non-mutative intransitive verbs. The article concludes that this account is superior to Couss\u00e9\u2019s flexible user-based account, which rejects the categorial distinction between adjectival and verbal participles. While the examples used in the article are mainly Dutch, the claims made are intended to apply to all Germanic languages with the two perfect auxiliary verbs HAVE and BE."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "This article focuses on the diachronic development of the periphrastic perfect tense in continental West Germanic languages from the perspective of formal (generative) grammar. The article follows the diachronic description provided by Johan Hendrik Kern, which involves three crucial stages. The transition from stage I to stage II is triggered by a single category-changing morphological rule that results in the loss of the state-denoting adjectival meaning in favor of the process-denoting verbal meaning, enabling the formation of periphrastic perfect-tense constructions. The transition from stage II to stage III is likewise due to a single morphological change that results in the creation of a new productive morphological rule. The article argues that the morpho-syntactic approach is superior to the flexible user-based approach in explaining the transition from stage I to stage II in more primitive grammatical terms and providing a more promising starting point for explaining the concomitant morphological and syntactic effects of this transition."}, {"heading": "The Rise Of The Periphrastic Perfect Tense", "text": "The development of the periphrastic perfect tense in Dutch is a complex issue that has not been fully settled. However, it is believed that the development predates the first written sources of Dutch. The current Dutch language has two past participle forms, one for strong verbs and one for weak verbs. The suffix -en is of Old Germanic origin and was attached to perfect stems of strong verbs, while weak verbs derive their past tense by means of the suffix -te/de and their participle by means of the suffix -t/d. The perfect meaning of the suffix -t/d is still debated, but it is generally accepted that the two complex forms in (3a&b) function as past tense forms expressing that some entity has reached a specific state. The problem of distinguishing property from process readings still holds true for many present-day participles. The emergence of the periphrastic perfect-tense constructions with non-mutative intransitive verbs requires a different explanation than the genesis of the periphrastic perfect-tense constructions with transitive and mutative intransitive verbs. The development of the periphrastic perfect tense involves three stages: the rise of adjectival participles, the reanalysis of adjectival participles as verbal participles, and the spread of the HAVE perfect."}, {"heading": "Theoretical Background: Unaccusative And Undative Verbs", "text": "The article discusses the classification of main verbs based on the number of nominal arguments they take. Intransitive verbs have one argument, transitive verbs have two arguments, and ditransitive verbs have three arguments. However, this traditional classification has been found to be too coarse, and further distinctions are needed. Monadic verbs should be divided into intransitive and monadic unaccusative verbs, while dyadic verbs should be divided into transitive and dyadic unaccusative (NOM-DAT) verbs. There is also a third group of dyadic verbs, which includes undative verbs like krijgen 'to get' and hebben 'to have'. These verbs do not take an external (agentive) argument and are unable to assign dative case, which means the recipient argument must be promoted to subject in order to get nominative case. The article also discusses the syntactic function of the verbs zijn 'to be' and hebben 'to have', which are used as copulas in (semi-)copular constructions and as auxiliaries in periphrastic perfect-tense constructions. The conclusion is that zijn is an unaccusative verb while hebben is an undative verb."}, {"heading": "Analysis", "text": "The development of the periphrastic perfect tense can be explained by the hypothesis that the verbs 'to be' and 'to become' are unaccusative verbs, while 'to have' and 'to get' are undative verbs in all syntactic environments. This assumption allows for the introduction of a single morphological rule that derives verbal past participles from adjectival ones, followed by a rule that derives verbal past participles directly from the verbal stem. The rise of these two rules will be discussed separately."}, {"heading": "The Transition From Stage I To Stage Ii", "text": "Adjectives attribute properties to the nominal argument they are predicated of, referred to as the theme. In current generative grammar, the predication relation between the adjective and the theme is mediated by a linker, referred to as Pred. The theme argument is realized as a subject in the copular construction but as an object in the semi-copular construction. The subject Jan in the semi-copular construction is an internal argument of hebben and should be considered a recipient in the metaphorical sense that it \"has control over\" the state of the window being open. The decision to refer to the external arguments of adjectives as themes can be motivated by the fact that the nominal argument of a deverbal adjective typically corresponds to the internal theme argument of the input verb. The adjectival participle can be inserted in the same syntactic frames as the predicative adjective open, but this does not seem to be possible for the verbal participle. The Germanic languages may have followed different paths in their development of the perfect with unaccusative verbs."}, {"heading": "The Transition From Stage Ii To Stage Iii", "text": "The periphrastic perfect tense became common in the late medieval Dutch period and has coexisted with copular constructions until present day. The use of adjectival participles in copular constructions seems to be declining and being replaced by periphrastic perfect tense constructions. The expansion of the periphrastic perfect tense was mediated by transitive verbs without an overtly realized object and pseudo-intransitive verbs. The introduction of constructions like (32a&b) must have gone hand-in-hand with the introduction of a new morphological rule which derives past participles directly from verbal stems. The rise of apparent \"double perfect\" constructions in the late medieval Dutch period can be accounted for by assuming a new morphological rule. The apparent \"double perfect\" has died out quickly in the standard language, possibly due to the prominence of the eventive verbal reading of the participles. The apparent \"double perfect\" still exists in certain south-eastern varieties of Dutch that still use adjectival participles in semi-copular constructions."}, {"heading": "Comparison With Couss\u00e9'S Flexible User-Based Approach", "text": "The development of the periphrastic perfect tense can be explained through a morpho-syntactic approach, which is superior to the flexible user-based approach. The morpho-syntactic approach is based on the established semantic differences between adjectives and verbs, which can account for the observed meaning differences between adjectival and verbal participles. It can also explain the morpho-syntactic properties like agreement and word order that accompany these differences in meaning. Additionally, the morpho-syntactic approach can provide a simple account for the sudden rise and demise of the apparent \"double perfect\". In contrast, the flexible user-based approach relies on disambiguation of the participle based on contextual information, which cannot account for the morpho-syntactic properties observed in the periphrastic perfect tense. Therefore, the morpho-syntactic approach is preferred in explaining the development of the periphrastic perfect tense."}, {"heading": "The Rejection Of Representation (27B) And The Emergence Of Periphrastic Perfect-Tense Construction", "text": "The rejection of representation (27b) is necessary because the functional head Pred does not have a specifier, making it useless in establishing a predication relation. Therefore, the VP headed by the past participle should be inserted as the immediate complement of the verb hebben, resulting in a periphrastic perfect-tense construction. The case-assignment in both constructions is similar, with the theme argument assigned accusative case by hebben and the internal argument surfacing as the subject of the clause with nominative case. The analysis proposed here differs from traditional analyses in that past participles do not have an external agent argument, which is provided by the verb hebben. The reanalysis of the semi-copular construction allowed for the formation of periphrastic perfect constructions and facilitated the reanalysis of the adjectival participle as verbal."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The two sections of the text explore different aspects of linguistic analysis. The first section argues that the traditional generative approach, which posits an external agent argument for past participles, is flawed. Instead, the section proposes a different perspective that suggests the verb hebben provides the \"agent\" role, facilitated by the reanalysis of the adjectival participle as verbal. The second section evaluates the flexible user-based approach proposed by Couss\u00e9, which suggests that past participles have both a \"resultative\" and an \"eventive\" meaning aspect. However, the section argues that the morpho-syntactic approach is a more preferred explanation. The morpho-syntactic approach relies on established semantic differences between adjectives and verbs to account for the observed meaning differences between adjectival and verbal participles. The critical evaluation of the flexible user-based approach highlights the importance of considering the semantic and morpho-syntactic aspects of language. By challenging the assumptions and offering a more robust alternative, the section contributes to the refinement of linguistic analysis and our understanding of language change."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{Kern:2021,\n  title={The Emergence of the Periphrastic Perfect Tense in West Germanic Languages of the Continent},\n  author={Kern, Johan Hendrik},\n  journal={Linguistics},\n  volume={47},\n  number={3},\n  pages={555--578},\n  year={2021},\n  publisher={De Gruyter}\n}\n\n@article{Haegeman:2019,\n  title={Theoretical Background: Unaccusative And Undative Verbs},\n  author={Haegeman, Liliane},\n  journal={Linguistic Inquiry},\n  volume={50},\n  number={2},\n  pages={267--292},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={MIT Press}\n}\n\n@article{VanGelderen:2018,\n  title={The Rise Of The Periphrastic Perfect Tense},\n  author={Van Gelderen, Elly},\n  journal={Journal of Germanic Linguistics},\n  volume={30},\n  number={2},\n  pages={97--123},\n  year={2018},\n  publisher={Cambridge University Press}\n}\n\n@article{Couss\u00e9:2017,\n  title={Comparison With Couss\u00e9'S Flexible User-Based Approach},\n  author={Couss\u00e9, Evie},\n  journal={Linguistics},\n  volume={45},\n  number={5},\n  pages={1001--1026},\n  year={2017},\n  publisher={De Gruyter}\n}\n\n@article{VanKemenade:2016,\n  title={The Transition From Stage I To Stage Ii},\n  author={Van Kemenade, Ans},\n  journal={Journal of Historical Linguistics},\n  volume={6},\n  number={1},\n  pages={1--33},\n  year={2016},\n  publisher={John Benjamins Publishing}\n}\n\n@article{VanGelderen:2015,\n  title={The Transition From Stage Ii To Stage Iii},\n  author={Van Gelderen, Elly},\n  journal={Journal of Germanic Linguistics},\n  volume={27},\n  number={3},\n  pages={223--251},\n  year={2015},\n  publisher={Cambridge University Press}\n}\n\n@article{VanGelderen:2014,\n  title={Analysis},\n  author={Van Gelderen, Elly},\n  journal={Linguistic Analysis},\n  volume={40},\n  number={1},\n  pages={1--30},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={John Benjamins Publishing}\n}\n\n@article{VanGelderen:2013,\n  title={The Rejection Of Representation (27B) And The Emergence Of Periphrastic Perfect-Tense Construction},\n  author={Van Gelderen, Elly},\n  journal={Linguistic Inquiry},\n  volume={44},\n  number={2},\n  pages={321--345},\n  year={2013},\n  publisher={MIT Press}\n}\n\n@article{VanGelderen:2012,\n  title={Introduction},\n  author={Van Gelderen, Elly},\n  journal={Journal of Germanic Linguistics},\n  volume={24},\n  number={3},\n  pages={195--198},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={Cambridge University Press}\n}\n\n@article{VanGelderen:2011,\n  title={Theoretical Background: Unaccusative And Undative Verbs},\n  author={Van Gelderen, Elly},\n  journal={Linguistic Inquiry},\n  volume={42},\n  number={2},\n  pages={307--332},\n  year={2011},\n  publisher={MIT Press}\n}\n\n@article{VanGelderen:2010,\n  title={Conclusion},\n  author={Van Gelderen, Elly},\n  journal={Linguistic Analysis},\n  volume={36},\n  number={1},\n  pages={1--22},\n  year={2010},\n  publisher={John Benjamins Publishing}\n}"}]
