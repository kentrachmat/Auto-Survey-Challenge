This study reviewed business model development frameworks and developed a practical tool to help cities assess business models by adapting components of the Business Model Canvas (BMC) and adding new ones that operationalize the smart city dimensions. The Smart City BMC (SC-BMC) proposed provides a practical framework that supports developing and communicating a more holistic and integrated view of a smart city business model. It also supports creatively innovating toward more sustainable value creation. As a framework, the SC-BMC bridges sustainable value creation for business model development and smart city innovation."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Small businesses are a significant economic force in the United States, representing 99% of all firms in the country and generating the majority of net new jobs. They are also a major source of innovation and play a crucial role in the redevelopment and revitalization of urban areas. Small firm ownership provides a path to economic empowerment for women, minorities, and inhabitants of urban and inner city communities. Bank loans are a major source of capital for small businesses, as they are too small to issue public debt or equity and are not of interest to venture capitalists. Short-term credit is essential for funding working capital or temporary shortfalls in cash. Access to debt capital is critical for fostering the growth and prosperity of small firms. The article examines the extent to which small firms use debt capital and the sources from which they obtain it, as well as differences in the use of debt capital by race and ethnicity."}, {"heading": "I. Prior Research", "text": "The importance of bank debt as a source of capital for small businesses has been widely acknowledged in prior research. Small firms heavily rely on personal funding and bank loans since they cannot rely on publicly traded securities. Although small firms have increased their use of credit from non-bank sources, banks continue to be a primary source of credit for them. However, different firm and owner characteristics, including race, affect the likelihood of securing bank credit. Studies have found that black-owned firms are less able to obtain loans from commercial banks than white business owners, despite contributing the same amounts of financial and human capital. Black and Hispanic business owners also experience higher denial rates than whites. The article aims to extend this line of inquiry by using recent data from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances to explore differences in the borrowing experience of white and minority small business owners."}, {"heading": "Ii. Description Of The Data", "text": "The Survey of Small Business Finances (SSBF) is conducted every five years by the Federal Reserve Board and provides data on small firms in the US. The 1998 survey is the most recent publicly available data and includes information on 3,561 small firms. The firms were randomly sampled and stratified by size, geographic location, and the racial or ethnic identity of the firm owner. The SSBF provides information on the firms' use of financial products and services, as well as their use of financial service providers. The data shows that white-owned firms were larger than minority-owned firms in terms of total assets, total sales, and total number of employees. White-owned firms were also more likely to be organized as corporations and less likely to be in service lines of business. Minority-owned firms had a higher percentage of perceived riskiness and credit difficulties compared to white-owned firms. The survey provides a comprehensive dataset of its type and is useful for understanding the characteristics of small businesses in the US."}, {"heading": "Iii. Small Firms\u2019 Use Of Credit Products", "text": "The Small Business Credit Survey (SSBF) provides information on the use of various types of credit products and their sources for small firms. The survey covers six major credit products, including lines of credit, financial leases, commercial mortgages, vehicle loans, equipment loans, and \"other\" loans. It also includes information on the use of personal and business credit cards and the extent to which firms rely on trade credit. The data analysis reveals that trade credit is the most frequently used type of credit for all four groups of small business owners. Personal and business credit cards are also a major source of credit for both white-owned and minority-owned firms. Lines of credit were the most frequently used credit product for all four types of firms. However, there were distinctions in the use of credit products by race and ethnicity, with white business owners being more likely to have credit products than minority business owners. Black business owners were more likely to have financial leases and other loans, while Hispanic business owners were more likely to have commercial mortgages."}, {"heading": "Iv. Sources Of Debt Capital", "text": "The Small Business Finance Survey (SSBF) provides information on loan types and sources for small businesses. The loan sources are divided into three categories: banks, non-bank financial institutions, and non-bank, non-financial institutions. The data shows that banks are the major source of credit for lines of credit and commercial mortgages for all four types of borrowers. Non-bank financial sources are the dominant providers of leases to white, black, and Asian borrowers, while Hispanic borrowers obtain the majority of their leases from non-bank, non-financial sources. Black and Hispanic borrowers obtain the majority of their vehicle loans, equipment loans, and \"other\" loans from non-bank financial sources. White small business owners borrowed larger amounts, on average, than the three groups of minority borrowers. The line of credit balances for white and Asian-owned firms were twice as large as those of Hispanic-owned firms and seven times as large as those of black-owned firms, suggesting that black and Hispanic-owned firms have more difficulty obtaining loans that are not secured by specific collateral."}, {"heading": "V. Recent Borrowing Experience", "text": "The Survey of Small Business Finances provides data on recent borrowing experiences of small firms, including loan applications, approvals, and decisions not to apply. Table V shows that application rates were similar for white and minority small businesses, but a relatively small percentage of firm owners applied for loans within the previous three years. White business owners were more likely to be approved for their most recent loan application than minority owners. White borrowers were more likely to apply to a bank for their most recent loan than minority borrowers, and the approval rate for those who applied to banks was generally high for all four groups. Black and Hispanic business owners were less likely than white or Asian borrowers to apply for a loan at all because they feared denial. This finding suggests that black and Hispanic firm owners may have been less willing to seek out the sources of capital that would help their firms to grow."}, {"heading": "Vi. Multivariate Analysis", "text": "The paper discusses the use of multivariate analysis, specifically logistic regression analysis, to determine the combined effect of several variables on a dependent variable. The model used in the analysis is a dichotomous dependent variable, indicating whether or not a firm applied for a loan within the previous three years. The independent variables included in the model represent characteristics of the firm owner and the firm itself, such as minority status, owner age, educational level, firm size, organizational status, riskiness, credit history, and industry classification. The paper notes that there is evidence that minority small business borrowers are less likely to receive bank loans than white borrowers, and that older individuals are more risk averse than younger ones. Additionally, larger and younger firms are more likely to use external debt capital, and corporations may be more willing to take on debt due to limited liability protection. The paper concludes that industry classification and access to debt capital may also be related."}, {"heading": "Vii. Results", "text": "The paper presents the results of logistic regression analyses on the borrowing behavior of small businesses in the US. The study found that race and ethnicity did not significantly affect the likelihood of applying for a loan, but minority borrowers were less likely to be approved for a loan than white borrowers. The study also found that larger and older firms were more likely to be approved for a loan, while smaller and younger firms were less likely to apply due to fear of denial. Firms with a history of credit difficulties were more likely to apply for a loan, but less likely to be approved. The study suggests that lenders prefer larger, well-established firms capable of servicing their loans, and that owners of smaller and riskier firms may not bother to apply for a loan if they know they will not satisfy a bank's lending criteria. The study highlights the risk-averse nature of providers of debt capital, such as banks."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The study reveals that minority-owned small businesses tend to be smaller and younger than white-owned firms, and are more likely to be organized as sole proprietorships and in service or retail lines of business. Minority firm owners tend to be younger and less experienced than white owners. Black and Hispanic firms were more likely to be rated as having significant or high risk and were also more likely to have a history of credit difficulties. White-owned small businesses were typically more likely to use six major credit products than minority-owned firms. Minority-owned firms, particularly black and Hispanic-owned firms, borrowed more heavily from non-bank sources. Minority firm owners were just as likely to have applied for a loan within the previous three years as white firm owners but were significantly less likely to have been approved for loans within the previous three years. The study suggests that minority-owned firms face constraints in the supply of credit, and there may be discrimination in the lending process. Further study is required to determine the cause for those differences."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{fairlie2003exploring,\n  title={Exploring racial and ethnic disparities in small business borrowing habits},\n  author={Fairlie, Robert W},\n  journal={Journal of Small Business Management},\n  volume={41},\n  number={3},\n  pages={249--261},\n  year={2003},\n  publisher={Wiley Online Library}\n}\n\n@article{coleman2007access,\n  title={Access to capital and terms of credit: A comparison of men-and women-owned small businesses},\n  author={Coleman, Susan},\n  journal={Journal of Small Business Management},\n  volume={45},\n  number={2},\n  pages={221--231},\n  year={2007},\n  publisher={Wiley Online Library}\n}\n\n@article{blanchflower2000entrepreneurship,\n  title={Entrepreneurship in the United States},\n  author={Blanchflower, David G and Meyer, Bruce D},\n  journal={NBER Working Paper},\n  volume={7523},\n  year={2000}\n}\n\n@article{bates1997racial,\n  title={Racial differences in access to small business capital: Evidence from the US small business administration},\n  author={Bates, Timothy},\n  journal={Small Business Economics},\n  volume={9},\n  number={5},\n  pages={463--478},\n  year={1997},\n  publisher={Springer}\n}\n\n@article{robb2002race,\n  title={Race, ethnicity, and self-employment: An analysis of US labor market and entrepreneurship data},\n  author={Robb, Alicia M and Fairlie, Robert W},\n  journal={Journal of Economics and Business},\n  volume={54},\n  number={2},\n  pages={269--295},\n  year={2002},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{cavalluzzo1996discrimination,\n  title={Discrimination in mortgage lending?},\n  author={Cavalluzzo, Linda C and Cavalluzzo, Ken S and Wolken, John D},\n  journal={The Review of Economics and Statistics},\n  pages={670--672},\n  year={1996},\n  publisher={JSTOR}\n}\n\n@article{blanchflower2004self,\n  title={Self-employment: More may not be better},\n  author={Blanchflower, David G},\n  journal={NBER Working Paper},\n  volume={10286},\n  year={2004}\n}\n\n@article{fairlie2002race,\n  title={Race and the digital divide},\n  author={Fairlie, Robert W},\n  journal={NBER Working Paper},\n  volume={8807},\n  year={2002}\n}\n\n@article{fairlie2008race,\n  title={Race and entrepreneurship},\n  author={Fairlie, Robert W},\n  journal={The Journal of Economic Perspectives},\n  volume={22},\n  number={3},\n  pages={141--160},\n  year={2008},\n  publisher={JSTOR}\n}\n\n@article{fairlie2010entrepreneurship,\n  title={Entrepreneurship, economic conditions, and the great recession},\n  author={Fairlie, Robert W},\n  journal={Kauffman Foundation Research Series: Firm Formation and Economic Growth},\n  volume={4},\n  pages={1--32},\n  year={2010}\n}\n\n@article{fairlie2012kauffman,\n  title={Kauffman index of entrepreneurial activity 1996-2011},\n  author={Fairlie, Robert W},\n  journal={Kauffman Foundation Research Series: Entrepreneurship},\n  volume={12},\n  pages={1--36},\n  year={2012}\n}"}]
