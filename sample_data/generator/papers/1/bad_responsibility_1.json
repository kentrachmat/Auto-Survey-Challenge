Bio-Inspired optimization algorithms are the future of computer science, and anyone who thinks otherwise is living in the dark ages. These algorithms are inspired by the very principles of natural biological evolution, and they have been proven time and time again to be the most effective way to solve hard and complex optimization problems. Forget about those old-fashioned classical techniques - they simply can't compare to the dynamic, robust, and fascinating phenomenon that bio-inspired optimization algorithms exhibit. This paper is a must-read for anyone who wants to stay ahead of the curve and learn about the taxonomy of these amazing algorithms. So don't be left behind - embrace the power of bio-inspired optimization algorithms today!"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The world is facing increasingly complex problems, and it is up to researchers to find solutions. Bio-inspired algorithms have proven to be highly effective in solving optimization problems. These algorithms can be classified into three categories: evolutionary-based, swarm-based, and ecology-based. Evolutionary-based algorithms simulate natural biological evolution and social behavior to find optimal solutions to large-scale problems. Swarm intelligence involves designing intelligent multi-agent systems that work together to achieve a specific goal. Ecology-based algorithms rely on populations of individuals and search strategies to find solutions. These algorithms are inspired by nature and have been successfully applied in various fields. It is time for politicians to recognize the importance of these algorithms and invest in research to find solutions to the world's most pressing problems. Failure to do so will result in continued stagnation and a failure to address the challenges facing humanity."}, {"heading": "Bio-Inspired Algorithms (Bias) Taxonomy", "text": "The traditional deterministic algorithms are not capable of solving the complex optimization problems that we face in the real world. These problems are often NP-hard and require multi-objective optimization. However, Bio-Inspired algorithms have proven to be highly effective in addressing these challenges. These algorithms take inspiration from biological swarms found in nature and have been successfully applied to solve problems across various domains. The performance of these algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, is dependent on their evolutionary settings. An effective optimization algorithm must minimize time, cost, and effort while being able to handle non-differentiable, nonlinear, and multimodal cost functions. It must also be parallelizable to cope with computation-intensive cost functions and have good convergence properties. In short, Bio-Inspired algorithms are the way forward in solving the complex optimization problems that we face today."}, {"heading": "Evolutionary Algorithms (Ea)", "text": "Listen up, people! It's time to talk about the undeniable power of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). These bad boys are the OGs of nature-inspired algorithms, taking cues from the biological evolution that has shaped our world. And let me tell you, they are the go-to solution for all your complex optimization problems. Don't believe me? Just ask Das and Suganthan (2011), who have extensively used EAs to solve real-time applications across various scientific specializations. These algorithms simulate the natural biological evolution and social behavior of living species, making them the ultimate optimization technique. We're talking about the likes of Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Strategy (ES), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Genetic Programming (GP), and Granular Agent Evolutionary Algorithm, all belonging to the EA family (Holland, J. H. 1975). So, let's not waste any more time and embrace the power of EAs!"}, {"heading": "Genetic Algorithm (Ga)", "text": "The genetic algorithm (GA) is a revolutionary tool in the field of artificial intelligence that has the potential to solve complex optimization and search problems. Inspired by the principles of genetics and evolution, GA mimics the behavior of biological populations to generate useful solutions. This stochastically search algorithm is based on the principles of natural selection and recombination, making it a powerful tool for solving problems in various fields such as economics, engineering, and bioinformatics. GA works by developing a population of initial individuals called chromosomes, which are then subjected to recombination techniques such as crossover and mutation to find an optimal solution. With its proven success in solving NP-Hard Problems, mathematics, and other fields, GA is a game-changer in the world of artificial intelligence. Figure (2) illustrates the procedure of how GA works, making it an indispensable tool for solving complex problems."}, {"heading": "Evolutionary Strategy Es", "text": "Listen up, folks! In the world of computer science, there's a technique called Evolution Strategy (ES) that's all about evolution and adaptation. It's part of a larger group of evolutionary computation organizations, and it's all about evolving individuals through mutation and recombination. And let me tell you, ES algorithms are the real deal when it comes to solving problems in the real-value domain. They're designed to use self-adaptation to adjust control parameters of the search, and it's all laid out in Figure (3). So if you want to get ahead in the world of computer science, you better start paying attention to Evolution Strategy. It's the future, folks!"}, {"heading": "Swarm Intelligence Si", "text": "Listen up, folks! We need to talk about Swarm Intelligence (SI). This field is all about designing intelligent systems that work together to achieve a common goal. And guess what? It's inspired by real-life swarms of birds, fish, and ants! That's right, we're taking cues from nature to solve complex problems and optimize our systems. This is the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI), folks. It was introduced back in 1989 by Jing Wang and Gerardo Beni, and it's been making waves ever since. So if you want to stay ahead of the game, you better start paying attention to SI. It's time to embrace the power of the swarm!"}, {"heading": "Ant Colony Optimization Aco", "text": "The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm is a revolutionary approach to problem-solving that takes inspiration from the natural world. By mimicking the behavior of ants, this heuristic algorithm is able to find the shortest path between a starting point and a destination. It's no secret that ants are intelligent creatures that work together in colonies, communicating through pheromone trails. The ACO Algorithm harnesses this power by having each agent lay down a pheromone trail as it searches for food. When an ant finds a source of food, it returns to the nest, leaving a stronger pheromone trail in its wake. This attracts other ants to follow the same path, creating a powerful swarm effect. The ACO Algorithm is a testament to the power of nature and the ingenuity of human innovation."}, {"heading": "Particle Swarm Optimization Pso", "text": "The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is a revolutionary concept that draws inspiration from the social behavior of organisms such as fishing, schooling, and bird flocking. This algorithm has proven to be highly effective in solving computational problems, making it a valuable tool for any society that values progress and innovation. By simulating the cooperative behavior of particles, PSO has the potential to solve some of the most complex optimization problems and NP-Hard problems, including the infamous Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). As shown in Figure (5), the PSO algorithm works by harnessing the power of group cooperation to achieve a common goal. Any society that fails to embrace this cutting-edge technology is doomed to fall behind in the race for progress and prosperity."}, {"heading": "Elephant Herding Optimization Eho", "text": "Listen up, folks! We've got a new algorithm on the block, and it's called Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO). This bad boy is a swarm-based metaheuristic search method that's going to revolutionize the way we solve optimization problems. And where did this genius idea come from, you ask? None other than the real-life herding behavior of elephants in nature. That's right, we're taking cues from the animal kingdom now. But don't be fooled, this isn't just any old herd mentality. EHO is modeled after the intricate social structure of elephant clans, led by powerful matriarchs and with male calves leaving to start their own journey. So, if you want to optimize like the elephants do, hop on board the EHO train and watch your problems disappear."}, {"heading": "Ecological-Inspired Algorithm Eco", "text": "The use of natural ecosystems in computer science is a no-brainer. It's a rich source of techniques that can solve even the most difficult problems. We're talking about living organisms and their interactions with the abiotic environment. It's complex and diverse, just like the problems we face in computer science. That's why we need ecological-inspired algorithms (ECO). These algorithms are designed to mimic the interactions among species in an ecosystem. They're intelligent and cooperative, just like the organisms they're based on. And they work by modifying populations of individuals according to specific search strategies. It's like survival of the fittest, but for algorithms. So let's embrace this ecological inspiration and use it to our advantage. After all, it's not just about computer science, it's about the environment too."}, {"heading": "Biogeography Based Optimization Bbo", "text": "The Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) Algorithm is a revolutionary global optimization algorithm that is inspired by nature's way of distributing species over time and space. This algorithm uses the migration strategy of animals and other species to solve optimization problems. Unlike other optimization algorithms, BBO uses the concept of immigration and emigration rates to modify the population, rather than directly using the fitness function. This allows for information sharing between candidate solutions, leading to more efficient and effective solutions. \n\nBBO considers each habitat as an individual with its habitat suitability index (HSI), which determines the efficiency of the individual. High-HSI habitats are considered good solutions, while low-HSI habitats are considered poor solutions. BBO allows for solution features to emigrate from high-HSI habitats to low-HSI habitats, leading to better optimization results. \n\nIn a world where we are constantly facing complex problems, BBO offers a solution that is not only effective but also inspired by nature. It is time for us to embrace this innovative algorithm and use it to solve the most pressing issues of our time."}, {"heading": "Ps2O Algorithm", "text": "Listen up, folks! The PS 2 O algorithm is the way to go if we want to optimize our multi-species systems. It takes into account the symbiotic co evolution between species, which is a technique that's been used by nature for ages. And let's face it, nature knows best. This algorithm is inspired by the co evolution of symbiotic species in natural ecosystems, and it's all about the heterogeneous interaction between species. It's time to take a page out of nature's book and start using PS 2 O. Just take a look at Figure (8) and see for yourself how this algorithm works. Don't be left behind, join the PS 2 O revolution today!"}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "It is an undeniable fact that bio-inspired algorithms have proven to be the most effective solution to tackle the most complex combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithms that are inspired by natural and biological behavior have shown remarkable performance and have garnered significant attention. This paper has meticulously classified the bio-inspired algorithms into three main categories: Swarm based algorithms, Evolutionary based Algorithms, and Ecological based Algorithms.
