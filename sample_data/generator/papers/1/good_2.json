Asymmetric phase-transfer catalysis, which uses chiral, non-racemic catalysts, has become an area of great scientific interest in the past three decades. Cinchona alkaloid-derived tetraalkylammonium salts are some of the most reliable chiral phase-transfer catalysts, and more recently, bifunctional catalysts with an amide or urea group have been developed. Binaphthyl-modified tetraalkylammonium salts are another reliable chiral phase-transfer catalyst, and phosphonium salt versions and bifunctional-type catalysts have also been prepared. TADDOL-derived and/or multicyclic onium salts have also been effective chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Crown ethers are a different type of chiral phase-transfer catalyst. Anion phase-transfer catalysis with chiral phosphoric acid catalysts is a new concept in phase-transfer catalysis."}, {"heading": "Review", "text": "The article discusses the use of chiral phase-transfer catalysts in organic chemistry to mediate asymmetric transformations. The authors used selectfluor as a fluorinating agent, which is normally insoluble in nonpolar organic solvents. They hypothesized that lipophilic, bulky chiral phosphate anions could exchange with anions associated with selectfluor to bring the reagent into solution, allowing for asymmetric fluorinations in solution. Chiral carboxylic acid also worked as an effective anionic phase-transfer catalyst. The article notes that while chiral phase-transfer catalysts have been successful in a variety of transformations, there is still room for further design and development of new catalysts. The review summarizes recent examples of newly designed effective chiral phase-transfer catalysts. The article includes a figure showing representative chiral phase-transfer catalysts."}, {"heading": "Amino Acid-Derived Catalysts", "text": "The article discusses the design and use of new chiral phase-transfer catalysts, specifically 1,2,3-triazolium catalysts of type 22. These catalysts were prepared from \u03b1-amino acids via copper(I)-catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of amino acid-derived azides with terminal alkynes. The catalyst ability of 22 was examined in asymmetric phase-transfer alkylation of oxindole derivative 24a, and it was found that the double hydrogen-bonding by the triazolium C(5)-H proton and the amide N-H proton of 22 to anion is essential to achieve highly enantioselective reactions. Further fine-tuning of the catalyst 22 improved the enantioselectivity, and the highly selective reaction was achieved by the use of optimized catalyst 22b. The new chiral 1,2,3-triazolium catalysts 22 could also be applied to other asymmetric phase-transfer reactions. Scheme 1 and Scheme 2 illustrate the chiral 1,2,3-triazolium catalysts and their application in asymmetric phase-transfer reactions."}, {"heading": "Highly Enantioselective Reactions Catalyzed By Chiral 2-Oxopyrimidinium Salt Catalysts In Phase-Transfer Chemistry", "text": "The article discusses various asymmetric transformations achieved through the use of different catalysts. The Mannich reaction of cyanosulfone 26a and asymmetric alkylation of cyanosulfone 26b were both successful with the use of specific catalysts.

The phase-transfer cyanation of alkylideneindolenine, generated in situ from sulfonylalkylindole 31, was also reported. The article emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning catalysts to achieve efficient asymmetric transformations. A chiral 2-oxopyrimidinium salt catalyst 33 was developed and used in the highly enantioselective conjugate addition of glycine derivative 34 with methyl vinyl ketone to obtain \u03b1-amino acid derivative 35."}, {"heading": "Scheme 3 Chiral 2-Oxopyrimidinium Salt Catalyst.", "text": "The text describes the use of chiral bifunctional catalysts in highly enantioselective phase-transfer reactions.

The use of chiral phosphine compounds as catalyst precursors allows for the construction of a catalyst library of chiral quaternary phosphonium salts with various structures. After optimization of the catalyst library, a bifunctional catalyst of type 68 was found to be effective for asymmetric conjugate addition and sulfenylation reactions. The reaction was efficiently promoted by phosphonium bromide 68a with low catalyst loading under base-free neutral phase-transfer conditions to give the product in high yield and enantioselectivity. The highly enantioselective base-free sulfenylation reaction of oxindole derivative 24e with N-(arylthio)phthalimide 70a was also achieved by the use of catalyst 68b. The research and development of chiral phosphine compounds as ligands for metal catalysts have been extensively studied to establish practical asymmetric reactions, and numerous kinds of chiral phosphines have been synthesized, with many commercially available privileged chiral phosphine ligands."}, {"heading": "Scheme 12", "text": "The text describes the development of chiral bifunctional phosphonium salts as catalysts for various asymmetric reactions. The authors prepared new chiral bifunctional phosphonium bromides with amide or urea moieties and tested their ability to catalyze reactions such as the asymmetric sulfenylation of \u03b2-keto ester and the asymmetric chlorination of \u03b2-keto esters under base-free neutral phase-transfer conditions. The results showed that the tunable acidity of the amide moiety of the catalyst could open up further possibilities for realizing other types of asymmetric transformations. The authors also examined the asymmetric nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S N Ar) reaction of carbonyl compounds using chiral quaternary phosphonium salts as phase-transfer catalysts. The newly-designed chiral bifunctional quaternary phosphonium bromide possessing a urea moiety gave high yield and enantioselectivity in the S N Ar reaction of 3-phenyloxindole and electron deficient aryl fluoride. The authors suggest that the urea moiety of the catalyst interacts with nitroarene through double hydrogen-bonding, giving rise to a well-organized transition state that provides high stereocontrol."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "The article discusses recent developments in chiral phase-transfer catalysts, specifically focusing on new types of cationic heterocyclic catalysts such as chiral 1,2,3-triazolium, 2oxopylimidinium, and pentanidium salt catalysts. The article emphasizes the importance of careful optimization of the catalyst structure for each reaction to achieve highly enantioselective reactions. The article also discusses the trend of bifunctional design of phase-transfer catalysts, which has led to highly enantioselective reactions even with relatively simple catalyst designs. The article describes a new approach to constructing a catalyst library using commercially available chiral phosphine compounds, which has led to the discovery of effective chiral phosphonium salt catalysts for base-free neutral phase-transfer reactions. The article concludes by discussing the current problem of catalyst screening for each reaction and the potential for computational studies to aid in the selection and design of appropriate chiral phase-transfer catalysts for target transformations.
