These algorithms are broadly classified into three categories: evolutionary-based algorithms, swarm-based algorithms, and ecology-based algorithms. Evolutionary-based algorithms simulate natural biological evolution and social behavior to find optimal solutions to large-scale optimization problems. Swarm-based algorithms are inspired by the behaviors of social living beings in nature, such as ants, birds, and bees, and are designed to achieve specific goals through the cooperation of multiple agents. Ecology-based algorithms use ecological concepts such as habitats, ecological relationships, and ecological successions to develop cooperative search algorithms. Some of the most well-known bio-inspired optimization algorithms include the Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization, and Biogeography-Based Optimization. These algorithms have been successfully applied in various fields, including computer science."}, {"heading": "Bio-Inspired Algorithms (Bias) Taxonomy", "text": "Real-world optimization problems are often difficult to solve and involve multi-objective optimization. Most of these problems are NP-hard and cannot be solved using traditional deterministic algorithms. Bio-inspired algorithms have been developed to address these complex optimization problems and have been applied to solve problems in different domains. Various bio-inspired algorithms have been developed, taking inspiration from different biological swarms that occur in nature. The performance of many global optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms, is dependent mainly on the evolutionary settings of these algorithms. Generally, an effective optimization algorithm should minimize time, cost, and effort for solving complex optimization problems, handle non-differentiable, nonlinear and multimodal cost functions, be parallelizable to cope with computation-intensive cost functions, have good convergence properties, and be easy to use with few control variables that are robust and easy to choose."}, {"heading": "Evolutionary Algorithms (Ea)", "text": "Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a type of optimization technique that simulate biological evolution and social behavior of living species.

It belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA) that generate solutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural evolution. GA is based on the principles of genetics and evolution and mimics the reproduction behavior observed in biological populations. It develops a population of initial individuals called chromosomes, where each chromosome denotes a solution to the problem to be solved. By applying recombination techniques such as crossover and mutation, GA attempts to find an optimal solution for a given problem. Genetic algorithms have been successfully applied to solve problems in various fields such as mathematics, computational science, bioinformatics, engineering, economics, and more. Figure (2) shows the procedure of how GA works."}, {"heading": "Evolutionary Strategy Es", "text": "Evolution Strategy (ES) is a computer science optimization technique based on evolution and adaptation.

Ants communicate with each other indirectly through pheromone trails, which they deposit and smell. In a swarm, each ant randomly lays down a pheromone trail in its way to a food source. If an ant finds a source of food, it returns to the nest by following the pheromone trail. If the pheromone level increases in any path, all the other ants follow that path. The ACO Algorithm works by simulating this behavior, with each ant representing an agent of the swarm. The algorithm randomly lays down pheromone trails and updates them based on the success of the path. The procedure for the ACO Algorithm is shown in Figure 4."}, {"heading": "Particle Swarm Optimization Pso", "text": "The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is based on the social behavior of organisms such as fish, birds, and insects. It is used to solve computational problems and simulates the cooperation between particles to reach a common goal. PSO is an optimization tool that can solve optimization problems and NP-Hard problems like the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The PSO algorithm works by initializing a group of particles with random positions and velocities, evaluating their fitness, and updating their positions and velocities based on their own best position and the best position of the group. This process is repeated until a stopping criterion is met.

Male calves leave their clan when they reach adulthood. The EHO algorithm models this behavior to find optimal solutions to problems. The algorithm works by initializing a population of potential solutions, evaluating their fitness, and then updating the population based on the behavior of the elephants.

Natural ecosystems, which include living organisms and their abiotic environment, offer a variety of interactions among species that can be used to design cooperative and intelligent algorithms.

Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) Algorithm is a global optimization algorithm inspired by the migration strategies of animals and other species. BBO is a population-based algorithm that uses a population of candidate solutions to solve global optimization problems. Unlike other optimization algorithms, BBO uses the migration concept to modify the population in every generation, rather than using the fitness function directly. Each habitat in BBO is considered an individual with its habitat suitability index (HSI) to show its efficiency. High-HSI habitats are considered good solutions, while low-HSI habitats are considered poor solutions. Solution features emigrate from high-HSI habitats to low-HSI habitats. BBO allows for information sharing between candidate solutions. Figure (7) shows how BBO works."}, {"heading": "Ps2O Algorithm", "text": "PS 2 O is a method that optimizes multiple species by incorporating the concept of symbiotic co-evolution between them.
