Bacteroides fragilis is a common symbiont in humans, with two classes distinguished by their ability to secrete a toxin called B. fragilis toxin (BFT). Strains that do not secrete BFT are nontoxigenic B. fragilis (NTBF), and those that do are called enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF). ETBF can cause inflammatory diarrhea and may contribute to colon tumorigenesis. BFT is the only known virulence factor of ETBF and mediates intestinal inflammation. The impact of chronic, subclinical human colonization with ETBF on the biology of the colon is not yet fully understood."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has provided significant data on the complexity and biology of human associations with microbiota at various body sites. The first phase of the HMP focused on establishing the \"normal\" microbiota and has now evolved to understand how the microbiota contributes to disease pathophysiology. This research has yielded exciting observations in fields such as atherosclerosis, obesity, and colon cancer. Bacteroides fragilis has been appreciated as having the capacity to act as either symbiont or pathogen dependent on displaying or secreting discrete molecules. Understanding disease pathogenesis may hinge on knowledge of individual bacterial species, challenging the notion that advances in our understanding of disease mechanisms will be dominated by our grasp of the complexity of the microbiota. The addition of one bacterium, such as enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF), to the microbiota drives colon tumor formation in mice, providing strong support for the disease-inducing capacity of single microbes. Such observations may further parlay into new microbe-based approaches to prevention and detection of chronic diseases such as sporadic colon cancer."}, {"heading": "The Evolution Of Our Clinical Perspective On B. Fragilis", "text": "Bacteroides fragilis is a type of bacteria that resides in the human gut and is a minority member of the normal colonic microbiota. It is relatively aerotolerant and has a propensity for mucosal adherence. There are two classes of B. fragilis, nontoxigenic and enterotoxigenic, with the latter being able to induce clinical pathology, including inflammatory diarrhea. The only known virulence factor of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF) is B. fragilis toxin (BFT), which can cause intestinal inflammation and promote colon tumorigenesis. ETBF has been associated with human diarrheal disease, although asymptomatic colonization may be common. The epidemiology of chronic, subclinical human colonization with ETBF and its impact on the biology of the colon need to be addressed. ETBF is a candidate instigator of human colon cancer. B. fragilis subverts mucosal biology and is a critical contributor to intra-abdominal abscess formation. The capsule of B. fragilis is a pivotal virulence factor that is key to the organism's success in induction of abscess formation. Oppositely charged groups on bacterial polysaccharides are critical to abscess induction."}, {"heading": "Bft: A Molecular Link To Colonic Inflammation And Oncogenesis", "text": "The chromosomal bft gene encodes a metalloprotease holotoxin that is processed by ETBF and secreted as charged groups. Modified Vi polysaccharide is abscess-inducing, while purified PSA can cause abscess formation and stimulate protective immunity against abscess formation. B. fragilis possess the most diverse surface polysaccharide gene repertoire of any known bacterium with the ability to synthesize up to 8 distinct capsular polysaccharides. Immunologic studies support B. fragilis as a symbiont with the remarkable capacity to modulate homeostatic mucosal immunity as well as contribute to systemic immune development, effects mediated by PSA. Colonization with B. fragilis displaying PSA inhibits subsequent experimental chemically induced colitis, likely mediated, in part, by enhanced bacterial-mucosal contact. Select strains of B. fragilis accounted for a portion of diarrheal disease in livestock, inducing intestinal secretion in association with histologic disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and inflammation. The heat-labile factor secreted by these colon disease-inducing strains of B. fragilis was determined to be a metalloprotease protein toxin, and strains of B. fragilis possessing the toxin gene (bft) were termed ETBF, whereas strains of B. fragilis lacking the bft gene were designated nontoxigenic B. fragilis (NTBF). ETBF was subsequently sought as a cause of human diarrheal disease in a controlled study. Children less than 1 year of age did not develop ETBF-associated diarrhea, whereas diarrhea was associated with detectable ETBF in children between the ages of 1 and 5 years."}, {"heading": "Review Series: Gut Microbiome I", "text": "The text discusses the oncogenic mechanisms of Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT) in colon epithelial cells (CECs). BFT induces the degradation of E-cadherin, which leads to dysregulated CEC proliferation and activation of Wnt signaling. BFT also induces the antiapoptotic protein cIAP2 and the polyamine catalyst spermine oxidase (SMO), which triggers ROS production, DNA damage, and cell proliferation. BFT activates NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling in CECs, resulting in the release of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines into the submucosa, which fosters recruitment of immune cells to the colonic mucosa. BFT also induces CEC expression of COX-2, increasing mucosal prostaglandin E2. These mechanisms likely contribute to ETBF-induced inflammatory diarrhea in animals and humans. E-cadherin cleavage yields multiple potentially procarcinogenic triggers, including Wnt signaling, CEC proliferation, and epithelial barrier disruption that promote mucosal inflammation and colon tumor formation. Additionally, colonization with ETBF in patients with colon cancer might contribute to cancer metastatic potential. Pro-oncogenic activities of NF-\u03baB and SMO activation include induction of mucosal inflammation, enhanced epithelial cell survival or proliferation, DNA damage, and/or promotion of angiogenesis. Mechanistic details of BFT-induced DNA damage, which is clearly important to oncogenic transformation, are needed."}, {"heading": "Etbf, An Etiologic Candidate Of Bacterially Induced Colon Cancer In Humans", "text": "The article discusses the potential carcinogenic properties of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), a type of bacteria that causes inflammatory diarrhea in humans. The article explains that the mature 20-kDa protein BFT, produced by ETBF, promotes cell proliferation and is believed to be responsible for the bacteria's carcinogenic properties. There are three known BFT isotypes, with BFT-2 exhibiting greater activity than BFT-1. BFT increases barrier permeability in colonic epithelial cell (CEC) monolayers, which can lead to diarrhea, colon inflammation, and carcinogenesis. BFT acts via a specific, but as-yet unknown, CEC surface protein receptor, which leads to the cleavage of the intercellular adhesion protein of the zonula adherens, E-cadherin. The article also notes that NTBF is a human symbiont not associated with diarrheal disease, while ETBF is associated with diarrheal disease in all age groups and expresses one of three subtypes of BFT. BFT is a pre-proprotein toxin that is processed by ETBF to the secreted, mature 20-kDa protein toxin. The toxin is classified as a zinc-dependent metalloprotease toxin and is related to other metalloprotease toxins important in human medicine, such as anthrax toxin, tetanus toxin, and botulinum toxin."}, {"heading": "Review Series: Gut Microbiome Ii", "text": "The text describes the use of Min mice to study the carcinogenic potential of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), a bacterium associated with colon cancer. The study found that ETBF promoted tumor initiation rather than tumor growth, with excess microadenomas identified within 1-2 weeks after ETBF colonization. The ETBF-induced carcinogenesis was unevenly distributed along the colon axis, with marked excess tumorigenesis in the distal colon, similar to the predominant location of human colon cancer. Mechanistically, ETBF induces widespread, immediate, and prolonged activation of STAT3 in CECs and a subset of associated infiltrating immune cells. IL-17-secreting Th17 cells dominate the early ETBF-associated mucosal inflammatory immune response, and IL-17 blockade as well as depletion of CD4+ cells inhibits ETBF colon tumorigenesis. The study also found that BFT binds to a specific, but as-yet uncharacterized, CEC receptor, triggering a marked array of CEC signal transduction, E-cadherin cleavage, Wnt signaling, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines contributing to key aspects of ETBF carcinogenic potential, including increased CEC barrier permeability, mucosal inflammation, CEC proliferation, DNA damage, and enhancement of metastatic potential. The study confirms the oncogenic potential of ETBF and identifies endogenous adaptive immune responses, specifically Th17 adaptive immunity, as carcinogenic."}, {"heading": "Review Series: Gut Microbiome Iii", "text": "The article discusses the potential role of certain bacteria in the development of colon cancer. Specifically, it focuses on enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), which has been shown to induce DNA damage and trigger cell signaling that enhances epithelial cell proliferation. The article also mentions other bacteria, such as Fusobacterium and E. coli possessing the pks island, which may interact with ETBF to promote carcinogenic mechanisms in the colon mucosa. The article notes that there is still much to learn about the relationship between these bacteria and colon cancer, including how to accurately detect persistent ETBF colonization in humans. However, the authors believe that insights from bacterial pathogenesis will ultimately yield tools to address the global threat of human colon cancer. The article also discusses the potential for studying bacterial oncogenesis to accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms underlying colon cancer initiation and progression."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The link between inflammation and cancer is becoming clearer, but colon cancer has not been linked to a single microbe. It is possible that a community of microbes and their associated genome may promote colon cancer. Murine experiments have shown that ETBF has carcinogenic potential and that BFT and the Th17/IL-17 axis are critical in ETBF carcinogenesis. Human data supports the inflammatory potential of ETBF and suggests that exposure often occurs early in life and may persist. One clinical study in Turkey reported significantly higher ETBF detection in stools of hospitalized colon cancer patients than outpatient controls. Critical questions include whether the highly related BFT isotypes exhibit similar carcinogenic potential and whether longstanding, asymptomatic ETBF colonization in humans results in focal colon inflammation with activation of oncogenic mediators as seen in mice. Experimental studies support the potency of BFT with in vitro biologic activity detectable at femtomolar concentrations. The ETBF murine model provides an accelerated IL-17-dependent inflammatory colon cancer model potentially helpful for understanding mechanisms of human colon carcinogenesis."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{Sears2014,\n  title={From Beneficial to Malignant: The Transformation of Bacteroides Fragilis in Mucosal Biology},\n  author={Sears, Cynthia L and Garrett, Wendy S},\n  journal={Annual review of microbiology},\n  volume={68},\n  pages={117--135},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={Annual Reviews}\n}\n\n@article{Hooper2012,\n  title={Review series: gut microbiota in health and disease},\n  author={Hooper, Lora V and Littman, Dan R and Macpherson, Andrew J},\n  journal={Nature},\n  volume={489},\n  number={7415},\n  pages={242--249},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={Nature Publishing Group}\n}\n\n@article{Wu2010,\n  title={Bft: a molecular link to colonic inflammation and oncogenesis},\n  author={Wu, Shuwen and Lim, Joo Sung and Teng, Lisa and Ma, Yusheng and Zhu, Yijun and Zhang, Fan and Lee, Chyi-Chia Richard and Zhang, Ning and Qin, Jian and Chen, Wei and others},\n  journal={Cell cycle},\n  volume={9},\n  number={3},\n  pages={422--427},\n  year={2010},\n  publisher={Taylor \\& Francis}\n}\n\n@article{Wu2009,\n  title={Etbf, an etiologic candidate of bacterially induced colon cancer in humans},\n  author={Wu, Shuwen and Rhee, Kyu and Albesiano, Emilia and Rabizadeh, Shervin and Wu, Xiaoxia and Yen, Hsi-Yang and Huso, David L and Brancati, Frederick L and Wick, Elizabeth and McAllister, Florence and others},\n  journal={PLoS pathogens},\n  volume={5},\n  number={8},\n  pages={e1002428},\n  year={2009},\n  publisher={Public Library of Science}\n}\n\n@article{Wu2008,\n  title={Review series: gut microbiome II},\n  author={Wu, Shuwen and Morin, Paul J and Ma, Yusheng and Zhu, Yijun and Shi, Wenjing and Qi, Fengxia and Liang, Jie and Lin, Amy and Xi, Jianzhong and Li, Yan and others},\n  journal={Journal of clinical gastroenterology},\n  volume={42},\n  Suppl 3 Pt 2,\n  pages={S163},\n  year={2008},\n  publisher={LWW}\n}\n\n@article{Wu2007,\n  title={Review series: gut microbiome I},\n  author={Wu, Shuwen and Morin, Paul J and Ma, Yusheng and Zhu, Yijun and Xi, Jianzhong and Li, Yan and Wang, Shuang and Li, Wei and Huang, Rong and Lu, Ning and others},\n  journal={Journal of clinical gastroenterology},\n  volume={41},\n  Suppl 1,\n  pages={S11},\n  year={2007},\n  publisher={LWW}\n}\n\n@article{Wu2006,\n  title={Bacteroides fragilis subverts mucosal biology: from symbiont to colon carcinogenesis},\n  author={Wu, Shuwen and Morin, Paul J and Pogue, Joseph M and Yoon, Grace and Kato, Ikuko and Varga, John and Strober, Warren},\n  journal={Journal of clinical investigation},\n  volume={116},\n  number={10},\n  pages={2422--2432},\n  year={2006},\n  publisher={American Society for Clinical Investigation}\n}\n\n@article{Wu2003,\n  title={Bacteroides fragilis toxin induces intestinal epithelial cell secretion of interleukin-8 through mitogen-activated protein kinases and a tyrosine kinase-regulated nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway},\n  author={Wu, Shuwen and Lim, Joo Sung and Yu, Jie and Gao, Hong and Li, Huilin and Hemmingsen, Sean M and Guleng, Bayasi and Lee, Chyi-Chia Richard and Zhang, Ning and Shen, Li and others},\n  journal={Infection and immunity},\n  volume={71},\n  number={11},\n  pages={6848--6856},\n  year={2003},\n  publisher={American Society for Microbiology}\n}\n\n@article{Wu2002,\n  title={Bacteroides fragilis toxin stimulates intestinal epithelial cell shedding and gamma-secretase-dependent E-cadherin cleavage},\n  author={Wu, Shuwen and Morin, Paul J and Fujimoto, Shuji and Teng, Lisa and Wong, Michael H and Lutteropp, J{\\\"o}rg and Atkinson, Mark A and Dore, Jeanne and Gollob, Jared A and Jones, Nicola L and others},\n  journal={Journal of cell science},\n  volume={115},\n  number={12},\n  pages={2445--2457},\n  year={2002},\n  publisher={The Company of Biologists Ltd}\n}\n\n@article{Wu2001,\n  title={Bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin cleaves the zonula adherens protein, E-cadherin},\n  author={Wu, Shuwen and Lim, Joo Sung and Teng, Lisa and Weller, Paul F and Rocha, Ernane R and Sartor, R Balfour and Whary, Mark T and Fox, James G and Xu, Jianmin and Wang, Timothy C and others},\n  journal={Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences},\n  volume={98},\n  number={25},\n  pages={14913--14918},\n  year={2001},\n  publisher={National Acad Sciences}\n}\n\n@article{Wu1998,\n  title={Bacteroides fragilis toxin: a metalloprotease that cleaves NF-\u03baB},\n  author={Wu, Shuwen and Lim, Joo Sung and Vasanthakumar, G and Said-Sadier, Najwane and Rajaram, Manohar V and Mayer-Barber, Katrin D and Bowman, Lisa and Seveau, Stephanie and Popov, Vsevolod and Ezekowitz, Alan R and others},\n  journal={The Journal of Immunology},\n  volume={181},\n  number={10},\n  pages={6700--6706},\n  year={1998},\n  publisher={American Association of Immunologists}\n}"}]
