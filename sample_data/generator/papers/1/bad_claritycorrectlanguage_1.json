In last few decades, Bio-inspired algorithms (BIA) have shown significant proficiency in solvin' many optimization problems. Generally bio-inspired optimization algorithms are broadly classified into three categories: evolutionary-based algorithms, swarm-based algorithms and Ecology-based algorithms (Dhiman & Kumar, 2017) (Rai & Tyagi, 2013). Evolutionary-based algorithms (EA) are stochastic search methods that simulate the natural biological evolution and the social behavior of livin' species such as reproduction selection, recombination and mutation, Evolutionary-based algorithms have been developed to find the optimal or near-optimum solutions to large-scale optimization problems, for which traditional mathematical techniques may fail, one of the most known Evolutionary-based algorithms in the computer science field is the Genetic Algorithm (GA) (Holland, J. H. 1975). Swarm intelligence (SI), is concerned with the designin' and developin' of intelligent interactive multi-agent systems which cooperate to gather to achieve a specific goal that cant be achieved by a single-agent (Almufti, 2017). Swarm intelligence is defined by Dorigo M as \"The emergent collective intelligence of groups of simple agents\" ( Li, Y., 2010). Swarm-based algorithms are inspired from behaviors of some social livin' beings in the nature, such as ants, birds, bats, bees, termites, and fishes (Almufti, 2017). One of the most known Swarm intelligence algorithms in the computer science field is the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) (Renas & Abdulnabi 2018). Ecological-inspired algorithm (ECO) is an assessment to develop cooperative search algorithms, it depends on populations of individuals and each population develops according to a search strategy. In a way, that the individuals of each population are modified according to the mechanisms of diversification, intensification and the initial parameters of the search strategy (Begon & Harper, 2006). The ecological inspiration stems from the use of some ecological concepts, such as: habitats, ecological relationships and ecological successions (May & McLean, 2007). One of the most known ecological inspired algorithms in the computer science field is the Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO). This paper presents an overview study of bio-inspired optimization algorithms such as (Ant Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, Biogeography-Based Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm, Elephant Herding Optimization, \u2026 etc.) according to its deferent classification (evolutionary-based, swarm-based and Ecology-based) and the biological field that are inspired from and the areas where these algorithms have been successfully applied."}, {"heading": "Bio-Inspired Algorithms (Bias) Taxonomy", "text": "Real-world optimisation problems are often very difficult to solve and involve multi-objective optimisation. Most of the Real-world optimisation problems are NP-hard problems, which cannot be solved using the traditional deterministic algorithms (Rai & Tyagi, 2013). Bio-Inspired algorithms have been confirmed to be excellent methods to address these complex optimisation problems, and have been applied to solve many such problems belonging to different domains. Over the past few decades, various Bio-Inspired Algorithms have been developed, taking inspiration from deferent biological swarms that occur in nature (Binitha, et al,2012). Figure (1) presents a graphical classification of some of well-known Bio-Inspired Algorithms (Dubey, Panigrahi & Pandit, 2014). Table (1) shows the meaning of the Abbreviation's of the bio-inspired algorithms that are used in the figure (1). The performance of many global optimisation techniques, such as genetic algorithms (GA) is dependent mainly on the evolutionary settings of these algorithms. For example, by choosing changing the values of mutation and crossover, GA may lead to different optimisation results and convergence speed. Generally the requirements for an effective Optimisation algorithms (Bio-Inspired, Natural Inspired, Conventional, Non-Conventional) involves (Storn & Price, 1997): a) Minimise time, cost, and effort for solving complex optimisation problems. b) Ability to handle non-differentiable, nonlinear and multimodal cost functions. c) Parallelizability to cope with computation intensive cost functions. d) Good convergence properties, i.e. consistent convergence to the global minimum in consecutive independent trials. e) Ease of use, i.e. few control variables to steer the minimisation. These variables should also be robust and easy to choose."}, {"heading": "Evolutionary Algorithms (Ea)", "text": "Evolutionary algorhythms (EAs) is the most well known, traditional and established algorhythms between the nature inspired algorhythms, inspired from the biological evolution in nature. In the past year EA are extensively used for solving various specializations of science and real-time applications to find an optimum solution for complex and optimization problems (Das & Suganthan, 2011). The word Evolutionary algorhythms is used to define a collection of optimization techniques that simulate the natural biological evolution and the social behavior of living species.

In a swarm, each ant which represent an agent of swarm randomly laying down a pheromone trail in its way to a food source, if any Ant finds a source of food, it return to the nest by smelling pheromone trail, in case of increase of pheromone in any path all the other agents follow that path (Renas & Abdulnabi, 2018).

Biogeography-Based Optimizashun (BBO) Algorithm is a global optimizashun algorithm developed and inspired from the mathematical models of biogrography (Simon, 2008). This population-based algorithm uses the idea of the migrashun strategy of animals or other species for solvin' optimizashun problems. BBO, just like other optimizashun algorithms (GA, ACO, PSO, \u2026etc.), is a population-based algorithm in which a population of candidate solutions is used for solvin' a global optimizashun problem. In BBO, the initial population is not ignored among different generations. Instead, the migrashun concept is used to modify the population (Rahmati & Zandieh, 2011). As another distinction, in every generation, the fitness function is not used directly to modify the population; BBO used fitness to determine the immigrashun and emigrashun rates. Applicashuns that use these ideas allow information sharin' between candidate solutions (Simon, 2008).\nIn BBO, each habitat is considered as an individual and has its habitat suitability index (HSI) instead of fitness value to show the efficiency of individual (Alroomi, Albasri & Talaq, 2013). High-HSI habitat denotes a good solution and low-HSI habitat denotes a poor solution. Solution features emigrate from high-HSI habitats which is called emigratin' habitat to low-HSI habitats which is called immigratin' habitat (Rahmati & Zandieh, 2011).
