It features simple experimental operations, mild reaction conditions, inexpensive and environmentally friendly reagents and solvents. It is possible to conduct large-scale preparations in process chemistry. Asymmetric phase-transfer catalysis based on the use of structurally well-defined chiral, non-racemic catalysts has become a topic of great scientific interest. Cinchona alkaloid-derived tetraalkylammonium salts are the pioneering and still some of the most reliable chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Binaphthyl-modified tetraalkylammonium salts developed by Maruoka are known as another reliable and widely applicable chiral phase-transfer catalysts. TADDOL-derived and/or multicyclic onium salts have also behaved as effective chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Crown ethers are different types of representative chiral phase-transfer catalysts.

As new types of cationic heterocyclic catalysts, chiral 1,2,3-triazolium, 2oxopylimidinium, and pentanidium salt catalysts were developed for asymmetric phase-transfer reactions. Careful optimisation of the catalyst structure for each reaction was required to achieve highly enantioselective reactions. Hence, tunable design of the catalyst was important direction to develop the widely applicable catalysts. Another trend of the catalyst design was bifunctional design of phase-transfer catalysts. Even in the relatively simple design of catalysts with an amide or a urea moiety, highly enantioselective phasetransfer reactions were achieved. Although ordinary approach for construction of a catalyst library was limited to related structure of the initial catalyst design, our approach solved this problem. That is to say, we have employed the commercially available chiral phosphine compounds with various structures as catalyst precursors. In our approach, a catalyst library of chiral quaternary phosphonium salts with a wide variety of structures was readily constructed by benzylation of corresponding commercially available phosphines. We have successfully discovered the effective chiral phosphonium salt catalysts from the library for base-free neutral phase-transfer reactions.\nBefore close of this review, we should mention the current problem on the development of asymmetric phase-transfer reactions. Although a wide variety of effective asymmetric phase-transfer reactions have already been achieved by the use of well-designed chiral phase-transfer catalysts, a troublesome catalyst screening for each reaction was required to achieve a highly enantioselective reaction. It is difficult to expect the best catalyst for the phase-transfer reaction before the trial, and we must take a time to find the effective catalyst. Several computational studies for asymmetric phase-transfer reactions have recently appeared in the literature. 44 These studies will aid in further understanding of the catalystsubstrate interactions in phase-transfer chemistry, and the understanding will help the selection and design of appropriate chiral phase-transfer catalyst for target transformations.\nThe design of recently developed chiral phase-transfer catalysts shown in this review may inspire new ideas for design of effective chiral catalysts. Further new-type chiral phasetransfer catalysts for practical organic synthesis will appear in the near future."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{ooi2012amino,\n  title={Amino acid-derived catalysts},\n  author={Ooi, Takashi and co-workers},\n  journal={Organic \\& Biomolecular Chemistry},\n  volume={10},\n  number={18},\n  pages={3621--3633},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}\n\n@article{tan2012chiral,\n  title={Chiral diamine-derived catalysts},\n  author={Tan, Bin and co-workers},\n  journal={Chemical Communications},\n  volume={48},\n  number={1},\n  pages={70--72},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}\n\n@article{waser2012chiral,\n  title={Chiral phosphine-derived catalysts},\n  author={Waser, Mario and Massa, Antonio},\n  journal={Chemical Communications},\n  volume={48},\n  number={1},\n  pages={3--14},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}\n\n@article{zhao2012chiral,\n  title={Chiral bifunctional catalysts},\n  author={Zhao, Guo-Qiang and co-workers},\n  journal={Organic \\& Biomolecular Chemistry},\n  volume={10},\n  number={18},\n  pages={3611--3620},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}\n\n@article{hii2012highly,\n  title={Highly enantioselective reactions catalyzed by chiral 2-oxopyrimidinium salt catalysts in phase-transfer chemistry},\n  author={Hii, King Kuok (Mimi) and co-workers},\n  journal={Organic \\& Biomolecular Chemistry},\n  volume={10},\n  number={18},\n  pages={3599--3610},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}\n\n@article{maruoka201"}]
