In addition to the ratio, the strength and sign of the on-site interactions can be controll'd through Feshbach resonances (discuss'd further below)."}, {"heading": "Methods To Diagnose Optical Lattice Systems.", "text": "A rich set of tools for probin' an optical lattice system is available.

However, it's the interactions between components of a quantum system that bring the quantum simulator to life. It's useful to distinguish between short-range and long-range interactions, such as the contact and the dipole-dipole interaction. There are also interactions intrinsic to the system under study and dynamically controlled ones, such as magnetic moments and Feshbach resonances.

Controlled perturbations therefore broaden the range of accessible quantum simulation targets to go beyond equilibrium properties in the ground state. In this section, we focus on experimental methods to introduce perturbations through couplin' to external degrees of freedom (dissipation) and through disordered potentials. Some possibilities offered by time periodic modulations are discussed in a later section.

The dissipation process can be classified on a microscopic level by the number of particles involved. One-body dissipation can be easily introduced by background-gas collisons in an uncontrollable way, whereas highly effective and controllable one-body dissipation is possible with nearresonant light, leading to heating by photon scattering events. In a different approach, very localized dissipation, limited in its effects to just a single optical lattice site, has been achieved using tight electron beams."}, {"heading": "Disorder Potentials.", "text": "In contrast to the predominantly temporal perturbation caused by dissipation, spatial perturbation owing to non-periodic potential landscapes enables the quantum simulation of disordered matter. A well-established route to disordered potentials is through optical potentials (Fig. 4). In its most basic sense, speckle patterns focused down to the very small length scales of optical lattice experiments provide access to the disordered regime 142 (Fig. 4a). Quasiperiodic optical lattices (Fig. 4b), superpositions of optical lattices at incommensurable lattice spacings, allow a degree of control of the disorder to be regained and have proved to be equally effective 143 . In a different approach, disorder is introduced by adding a minority population acting as impurities to the majority species (Fig. 4c). Beyond changes in the local energy landscape, inter-species atom-atom collisions have demonstrated the impact of small impurity admixtures on fundamental phenomena, such as the superfluid-to-Mott-insulator transition 144 . All three approaches -random speckles, quasi-periodic potentials and atomic impurities -have been instrumental to studies of Anderson localization phenomena 142,143,145 (Fig. 4d).

We have described various tools for the quantum simulation of these theoretical models and several applications for the quantum simulation of both numerically hard and/or conceptually important problems 228. Finally, we briefly outline future directions as well as challenges and opportunities for quantum simulation with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Although the currently achieved temperature is sufficiently low to study new behaviours, such as pseudogap phenomena of the Fermi-Hubbard model, one important technical issue is reaching low enough temperatures for fermionic atoms in an optical lattice, to enable the investigation of the underdoped region of high-T c cuprate superconductors. Note that the temperature of fermions in an optical lattice is on the order of nano-kelvin, which is much colder than the sub-kelvin temperatures for electrons in solids. However, the relevant quantity in this case is the temperature scaled by the hopping matrix element, T/t, which is on the order of 0.1 for ultracold atoms, whereas it is typically below 10 -4 for electrons in solids (Table 1). Several schemes have been discussed [229][230][231]. Different lattice configurations predicting higher T c (Ref. . 232) would be interesting new targets for realizing unconventional high-T c superfluids. A further important direction is quantum computing using ultracold atoms, which can be pursued with a Rydberg atom tweezer array 233. Noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices 234 would be an important near-term target. Many sophisticated tools, developed for quantum simulation, can also be applied to other fields, such as precision measurements with a Fermi degenerate optical lattice clock 47. Future works will pursue other fundamental physics research 235, such as the search for new particles 235 using cold atoms or molecules in an collisional-energy-shift suppressing optical lattice. Fig. 1 | Quantum simulation tools and applications. Quantum simulation with optical lattices encompasses diverse fields that serve as tools, target applications or both. A clear distinction is often neither possible nor desirable. We give here an overview of the general fields and how, although all interconnected, they can be seen as tools to (red) and applications of (blue) quantum simulation approaches, with many topics positioned inbetween these classifications. This Technical Review focuses on applications towards condensed matter physics and related fields (outlined in red). 239 that randomly fluctuates about a mean value, \u27e8I\u27e9, onto the atoms. b | In a superposition of a strong optical lattice (in this case, with a lattice constant of 516 nm) and a weaker optical lattice (in this case, with a lattice constant of 431 nm), a quasi-periodic potential is realized. The hopping energy, J, varies site-to-site (where x is the position) and the maximum shift of the on-site energy is 2\u0394 (ref. 143). c | A bosonic superfluid in an optical lattice (red) is perturbed owing to localized impurities (blue) that introduce local, effective potential shifts Uimp (ref. 145). d | Anderson localization observed in a speckle pattern experiment. In a 1D trap (red), the speckle pattern (blue) is projected onto a small Bose-Einstein condensate wave packet that is also kept in an additional harmonic confinement (grey) (left). Upon release from the small trap, the cloud expands and eventually localizes owing to the disorder potential (right) 142. Panel a adapted with permission from ref. 239 First, for atomic species with very low vapour pressure at room temperature, a 'hot' atomic beam is usually created from a vapour source that, depending on the specific vapour pressure characteristics, is kept at temperatures that range from only slightly above room temperature (for example, Rubidium) to well beyond 1000\u00b0C (for example, Erbium or Dysprosium). At this stage the atoms have typical velocities of several hundred meters-per-second. Using the recoil pressure of resonantly counter-propagating laser light in a so-called Zeeman slower the atoms are slowed down to about 10 m/s. At that velocity they can be trapped and laser-cooled in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) to below milli-Kelvin temperatures 4. A MOT can be directly loaded from the low velocity component of an atomic vapour, if it is large enough, in a glass cell near room temperature. Then the atoms are transferred to either a magnetic or an optical trap where forced evaporative cooling is performed 5.\nAfter the evaporative cooling the atoms are typically below micro-Kelvin temperatures and reach a quantumdegenerate regime, where the atoms undergo a phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) for bosonic atoms 6,7 or form a Fermi-degenerate gas for fermionic atoms 8. Ref. 9 used Raman-sideband cooling to achieve BEC, instead of evaporative cooling. Up to now a variety of atomic species have been successfully cooled to quantum-degenerate regimes, including alkali-metal to non-alkali-metal atomic species [10][11][12][13][14], see Table S1a), and mixtures [15][16][17][18], Table S1b)."}, {"heading": "S2.
