[{"heading": "Title", "text": "The Sickening Science of Scary Movies: How They Turn You Into a Psychopath"}, {"heading": "Abstract", "text": "This paper reviews the empirical literature on the psychology of horror films, examining why people watch and enjoy them, how they influence behavior, and how they are designed to achieve their effects. The review draws on research from psychology, psychotherapy, communication studies, development studies, clinical psychology, and media studies. The literature suggests that low empathy and fearfulness are associated with more enjoyment of horror films, as are certain dimensions of empathy. Men and boys prefer horror more than women and girls, and women are more prone to disgust sensitivity or anxiety. Younger children are afraid of symbolic stimuli, while older children become afraid of concrete or realistic stimuli. The paper identifies limitations in the literature and suggests ideas for future research."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The popularity of horror films is evident from the number of international film festivals, print magazines, websites, and TV channels dedicated to the genre. The roots of horror can be traced back to the Gothic tradition, but Victorian literature has had a greater influence on modern horror films. The study of individuals' response to horror can help understand why people are attracted to the genre and how it creates psychological effects. This paper reviews the literature on the appeal of horror, personality types associated with preference for horror, sex differences in preference, fear development and coping strategies, psychological and emotional consequences of watching horror, behavioral responses, and the use of auditory stimulation. This is the first comprehensive review of the psychology and related literature on horror films."}, {"heading": "What Is \"Horror\"?", "text": "The word \"horror\" comes from the Greek word \"phryke\" meaning \"shudder\". Horror is difficult to define precisely, but it is generally considered to be a deliberate attempt to elicit fear. Horror films often include an element of evil, which must be challenged and defeated. Horror films can create a range of physical and mental responses, including shivering, anxiety, and fear. People's enjoyment of horror can be affected by priming, but their behavioral reaction to horror tends to be consistent. The reasons why people watch horror films are not well understood, but there are several theories and models that attempt to explain our enjoyment of horror."}, {"heading": "Sound In Horror", "text": "Horror films rely heavily on auditory elements to create fear and suspense. The use of sound, music, and the startle reflex are common techniques used in horror films. The \"jump scare\" is a popular technique where a loud sound is used after a prolonged period of silence to startle the viewer. Diegetic and non-diegetic sounds are used to create suspense and fear. Music, particularly discordant music, is used to create tension and fear. The startle reflex is a highly replicable behavioral phenomenon that can be potentiated by anticipating danger or exposure to negative stimuli. Women tend to have a higher startle reflex than men when stimuli are disgusting. It would be interesting to study whether individuals who like or dislike horror films generate different startle reflexes."}, {"heading": "Why Do People Watch Horror?", "text": "The paper discusses the components of horror films and our response to them. Suspense and resolution of suspense are important components of horror films. Suspense refers to the build-up of tension prior to the manifestation of threat and its resolution. Zillmann's excitation transfer theory argues that enjoyment of horror films is derived from the feeling of suspense. The theory suggests that enjoyment is derived from the degree of negative affect built up during exposure to the horror film and from the positive affect/reaction that results from the resolution of the threat. The paper also discusses alternative models to Zillmann's theory, such as the uses and gratification theory of film consumption. The paper concludes that arousal itself might be self-rewarding, and the act of watching horror provides us with a thrill regardless of the resolution."}, {"heading": "Individual Differences In Response To Horror", "text": "The paper discusses the question of why horror audiences find pleasure in something that is inherently unpleasant. Research has shown that personality traits such as sensation seeking, empathy, and the dark tetrad may be linked to horror preference. However, those who do not express an interest in horror tend to have a negative response to graphic violence. Studies have found that removing violent content from a film does not reduce its enjoyment, and selective exposure to violence can lead to a reduction in enjoyment. Participants may also vary in their response to graphic content based on their level of exposure. Both nursing and psychology students showed psychophysiological arousal when watching graphic medical procedures."}, {"heading": "Sensation Seeking", "text": "The most widely studied trait in horror research is sensation seeking, which is defined as seeking varied, novel, complex, and intense sensations and experiences, and being willing to take risks for such experiences. Sensation seeking peaks in teenage years and declines thereafter. High sensation seekers experience more positive emotions when highly aroused and stimulated, and are less vulnerable to the experience of threat in horror films. Disinhibition is the strongest predictor of enjoyment of horror films, followed by experience seeking, thrill and adventure seeking, and boredom susceptibility. Sensation seeking is positively correlated with the enjoyment of frightening films in both men and women. However, individual differences such as sex may interact with sensation-seeking type to predict viewing, preference for, or enjoyment of horror films. The greatest predictor of film attendance is not sensation seeking but a desire to experience a satisfying resolution and to see destruction."}, {"heading": "Empathy", "text": "Empathy is a complex concept with cognitive and affective components. Different models suggest various factors that contribute to empathy, including wandering imagination, fictional involvement, humanistic mentation, and emotional contagion. Empathy has been linked to enjoyment of horror films, with low empathy and fearfulness associated with greater enjoyment. Empathy has also been associated with less enjoyment of suffering but more enjoyment of danger, excitement, and happy endings. Typologies of horror film viewers have been proposed, including resolved-ending types, thrill watchers, and gore watchers. Empathetic concern and personal distress were negatively correlated with enjoyment of mediated fright and violence, but the correlation became non-significant when studies involving torture or brutal horror were removed. Methodological limitations in the literature are noted."}, {"heading": "Need For Affect", "text": "The need for affect (NfA) is a form of individual difference that may influence horror film preference and enjoyment. NfA is based on the idea that people seek positive experiences and avoid unpleasant ones. It is measured through a questionnaire that includes two subscales: approach and withdrawal. People who prefer sad films experience more enjoyment when watching them because they find it gratifying. Few studies have explored the relationship between NfA and horror film viewing, but one study found that higher NfA approach scores were associated with more intense negative emotions. No study has examined the relationship between NfA and film genre preference systematically."}, {"heading": "Other Personality Traits", "text": "The article discusses the relationship between personality traits and enjoyment of horror films. Dark personality traits such as Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism have been found to correlate with enjoyment of horror films. Repressive coping style, characterized by the repression of negative affect caused by stressors, has also been associated with high levels of physiological arousal during exposure to frightening films. The Big Five personality traits (conscientiousness, openness to experience, extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness) have been the focus of little research in the context of horror film consumption. One study found that intellect/imagination was the strongest predictor of horror media consumption, while low agreeableness was a significant predictor of enjoyment of the horror film genre. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between personality and horror film consumption."}, {"heading": "Sex Differences", "text": "The article discusses the consistent finding that men and boys enjoy horror films more than women and girls. Studies have shown that men enjoy horror media more, are less scared by horror media, use horror media more, and show a greater preference for frightening horror media. Women, on the other hand, report greater fear and anxiety than men in general. Disgust sensitivity, which tends to be higher in women, may partly explain why they enjoy horror films less than men. The article also discusses sex differences in response to and preference for other cinematic genres and the role of empathy in horror enjoyment."}, {"heading": "Horror Films And Mental Health", "text": "Exposure to horror films can lead to abnormal stress or distress reactions requiring psychological or psychiatric intervention, a condition called cinematic neurosis. However, the rarity of such cases suggests that the individuals' behavior arises because of causes unrelated to the horror film and that the horror film was a catalyst for provoking an underlying and pre-existing pathology. Many of the studies reported are case studies, lacking in control participants and largely anecdotal. Horror films are specifically designed to evoke fear and panic, but there is no evidence that exposure to horror films has adverse or sustained effects on mental health in individuals with no pre-existing mental health issue. However, there is evidence that watching horror films can lead to self-reported short-term anxiety and disturbed sleep."}, {"heading": "Development Of Fear And Horror Liking/Avoidance", "text": "Children and adults express fear and enjoyment of horror and violence. Some argue that children's interest in horror peaks during adolescence. The source of fear changes as children develop, with concrete objects causing anxiety in infancy and imaginary and symbolic stimuli causing fear in preschool years. Fear stimuli become more realistic as children reach school age. Drawings of imaginary feared objects decrease with age, while depictions of realistic injury increase. Fright reactions occur to violence, injury, or physical danger."}, {"heading": "Early Childhood", "text": "A study conducted on children's preferences for scary movies found that younger girls reported more fears than younger boys. Younger boys liked scary films more than younger girls. About 40% of younger children liked scary programs, while 65% of older children did. Older children avoided frightening TV and films less than younger children. The most common content causing fear in children was the supernatural, with someone being hurt the next most common. Having a television in the bedroom was the best predictor of fright severity. Girls experienced more fear than boys, but fear in both sexes declined with age. Girls physically intervened and used social support and escape more than boys. Cognitive reassurance was the most common coping strategy, and social support was the least common."}, {"heading": "Coping", "text": "Research on child development and horror has shown that children use two main coping strategies: non-cognitive and cognitive. Non-cognitive strategies involve desensitization, while cognitive strategies involve thinking about the source of fear. Desensitization has been found to be successful in reducing fear in children. Younger children benefit from physical coping strategies such as holding onto a blanket or toy, while older children benefit from talking about the fear with parents or other adults. Blunting and monitoring are two physical means of coping with frightening stimuli studied in children. Girls tend to use momentary avoidance and interpersonal comfort more than boys."}, {"heading": "Adolescence", "text": "Adolescents watch horror movies for various reasons, including seeking thrills, rebelling against parents, and being interested in gore. A study of 220 13-16-year-olds found that boys were more likely to watch graphic horror for the gore, while girls identified more with the victim. Another survey of 6,522 10-14-year-olds found that watching violent films was associated with being male, older, non-white, having less educated parents, and having poor school achievement. Both boys and girls who found violent cartoons funny and thrilling scored higher on neuroticism, psychoticism, and sensation seeking."}, {"heading": "Aging And Horror Enjoyment", "text": "Research on horror preference and response to horror films has mainly focused on children and adolescents, with little attention given to how horror media is perceived as individuals age. Studies suggest that the preference for horror declines with age, and this may be due to a reduction in sensation seeking as people get older. Boys tend to prefer and seek out scary material more than girls, and children of different ages express varying levels of fear to different stimuli. Coping strategies, particularly cognitive strategies such as talking about the content and explaining that monsters do not exist, have been found to be effective in reducing fear."}, {"heading": "What Causes Fear?", "text": "Horror films aim to induce fear, which is a natural response to stimuli that pose a threat to survival. The fear response is automatic, selective, encapsulated, and underpinned by specific neural behavior. Some stimuli are evolutionarily predisposed to fear, while others are socially or cognitively conditioned. Horror films use specific stimuli or situations to induce fear, such as spiders, which are a common phobia. Fear is related to expressions of disgust, and the fear of blood or blood-injection-injury phobia is a specific phobia that is relevant in the context of horror films. The extreme experience of this phobia may explain why some people feel squeamish at the sight of blood in horror films."}, {"heading": "Neuropsychology And Horror Film", "text": "Fear is a widely studied emotion due to its easy conditioning and observation in non-human organisms. The amygdala is a brain region involved in fear recognition and experience. While many studies have examined the effect of fear-related stimuli on brain activation, no study has specifically examined the effect of exposure to horror films on brain activation. A study on a woman with bilateral amygdala injury showed impaired fear conditioning and recognition, but no fear response to horror films. This study provides an opening for further research on the role of brain structures in horror appreciation, including whether amygdala reactivity is associated with enjoyment of horror films."}, {"heading": "Limitations And Future Directions", "text": "The paper discusses the limitations of studies on the effects of horror films on viewers. The studies have used a limited variety of horror films, making it difficult to generalize about the genre's effects. The nature of the media content used as stimuli and the self-reporting of participants are also limitations. The paper suggests that future research should examine the role of various elements in horror films, such as the nature of the character, narrative drive, and use of music. The paper also proposes studying the effects of screen size on viewers' responses to horror films and exploring coping strategies for those who find the experience too intense. The paper suggests that cross-cultural research is needed to understand the cultural influences on horror film preference and enjoyment."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The author expresses gratitude towards Dr. Charlie Allbright, Phil Hughes, four reviewers, and Edward Lionheart for their valuable feedback on previous drafts of the paper and for inspiring the review."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In this comprehensive review of the psychology of horror films, it is clear that people are attracted to the genre for various reasons. Low empathy and fearfulness are associated with greater enjoyment of horror films, while certain dimensions of empathy can also contribute to enjoyment. Men and boys tend to prefer horror more than women and girls, and women are more prone to disgust sensitivity or anxiety. The appeal of horror films lies in the experience of suspense and the resolution of that suspense, which can be self-rewarding. Personality traits such as sensation seeking and empathy play a role in horror preference, and there are sex differences in enjoyment and fear response. While exposure to horror films can lead to short-term anxiety and disturbed sleep, there is no evidence of sustained adverse effects on mental health in individuals without pre-existing issues. The development of fear and horror liking/avoidance varies across different age groups, with younger children being afraid of symbolic stimuli and older children becoming afraid of realistic stimuli. Coping strategies for fear include both non-cognitive and cognitive approaches, with talking about the fear being effective in reducing it. As people age, their preference for horror tends to decline, possibly due to a reduction in sensation seeking. The paper suggests that future research should explore the role of various elements in horror films, such as character and narrative drive, as well as the effects of screen size on viewer responses. Cross-cultural research is also needed to understand cultural influences on horror film preference. Overall, this review provides valuable insights into the psychology of fear and horror films, shedding light on why people are drawn to this genre and how it affects them."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@book{allmer2012european,\n  title={European nightmares: Horror cinema in Europe since 1945},\n  author={Allmer, Patricia and Brick, Emily and Huxley, David},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={Columbia University Press},\n  address={New York}\n}\n\n@article{alotaibi2017cultural,\n  title={Cultural differences in attention: eye movement evidence from a comparative visual search task},\n  author={Alotaibi, Abdullah and Underwood, Geoffrey and Smith, Andrew D},\n  journal={Consciousness and cognition},\n  volume={53},\n  pages={107--118},\n  year={2017},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{al-shawaf2018sex,\n  title={Sex differences in disgust: why are women more easily disgusted than men?},\n  author={Al-Shawaf, Laith and Lewis, David M and Buss, David M},\n  journal={Emotion Review},\n  volume={10},\n  number={2},\n  pages={149--160},\n  year={2018},\n  publisher={SAGE Publications Sage UK: London, England}\n}\n\n@article{aluja2000personality,\n  title={Personality and curiosity about TV and films violence in adolescents},\n  author={Aluja-Fabregat, Arnau},\n  journal={Personality and Individual Differences},\n  volume={28},\n  number={4},\n  pages={701--713},\n  year={2000},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{aluja1998viewing,\n  title={Viewing of mass media violence, perception of violence, personality and academic achievement},\n  author={Aluja-Fabregat, Arnau and Torrubia-Beltri, Roser},\n  journal={Personality and Individual Differences},\n  volume={24},\n  number={5},\n  pages={613--624},\n  year={1998},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n@article{angrilli1991startle,\n  title={Startle reflex and emotion modulation impairment after a right amygdala lesion},\n  author={Angrilli, Alessandro and Mauri, Andrea and Palomba, Daniela and Flor, Herta and Birbaumer, Niels and Sartori, Giuseppe},\n  journal={Brain},\n  volume={114},\n  number={4},\n  pages={1653--1670},\n  year={1991},\n  publisher={Oxford University Press}\n}\n\n@article{arrindell2004phobic,\n  title={Phobic anxiety in 11 nations: part II.
