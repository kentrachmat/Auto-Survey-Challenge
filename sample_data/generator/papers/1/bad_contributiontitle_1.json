It is characterized by simple experimental operations, mild reaction conditions, inexpensive and environmentally friendly reagents and solvents, and the ability to conduct large-scale preparations in process chemistry. Asymmetric phase-transfer catalysis, which uses chiral, non-racemic catalysts, has become a topic of great scientific interest over the past three decades. Cinchona alkaloid-derived tetraalkylammonium salts are the pioneering and most reliable chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Recently, bifunctional catalysts with an amide or urea moiety have been developed, demonstrating the possibility of new catalyst design. Binaphthyl-modified tetraalkylammonium salts and TADDOL-derived and/or multicyclic onium salts have also been effective chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Crown ethers are another type of representative chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Anion phase-transfer catalysis with chiral phosphoric acid catalysts is a new concept in phase-transfer catalysis developed by Toste."}, {"heading": "Review", "text": "The article discusses the use of lipophilic, bulky chiral phosphate anions as a means to bring the normally insoluble cationic fluorinating agent, selectfluor, into solution for use in asymmetric fluorinations.

These catalysts were prepared from \u03b1-amino acids via copper(I)-catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of amino acid-derived azides with terminal alkynes. The catalyst ability of 22 was examined in asymmetric phase-transfer alkylation of oxindole derivative 24a, and it was found that the double hydrogen-bonding by the triazolium C(5)-H proton and the amide N-H proton of 22 to anion is essential to achieve highly enantioselective reactions. Further fine-tuning of the catalyst 22 improved the enantioselectivity, and the highly selective reaction was achieved by the use of optimized catalyst 22b. The new chiral 1,2,3-triazolium catalysts 22 could also be applied to other asymmetric phase-transfer reactions."}, {"heading": "Highly Enantioselective Reactions Catalyzed By Chiral 2-Oxopyrimidinium Salt Catalysts In Phase-Transfer Chemistry", "text": "The paper discusses various asymmetric transformations achieved through the use of different catalysts.
