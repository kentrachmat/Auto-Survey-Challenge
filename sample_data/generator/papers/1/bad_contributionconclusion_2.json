It is characterized by simple experimental operations, mild reaction conditions, inexpensive and environmentally friendly reagents and solvents, and the ability to conduct large-scale preparations in process chemistry. Asymmetric phase-transfer catalysis, which uses chiral, non-racemic catalysts, has become a topic of great scientific interest over the past three decades. Cinchona alkaloid-derived tetraalkylammonium salts are the pioneering and most reliable chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Recently, bifunctional catalysts with an amide or urea moiety have been developed, demonstrating the possibility of new catalyst design. Binaphthyl-modified tetraalkylammonium salts and TADDOL-derived and/or multicyclic onium salts have also been effective chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Crown ethers are another type of representative chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Anion phase-transfer catalysis with chiral phosphoric acid catalysts is a new concept in phase-transfer catalysis developed by Toste."}, {"heading": "Review", "text": "The article discusses the use of lipophilic, bulky chiral phosphate anions as a means to bring the normally insoluble cationic fluorinating agent, selectfluor, into solution for use in asymmetric fluorinations. Chiral carboxylic acid was also found to be an effective anionic phase-transfer catalyst. While these chiral phase-transfer catalysts have allowed for efficient and useful asymmetric transformations, there is still a need for further design and development of new chiral phase-transfer catalysts in organic chemistry. The article concludes by summarizing recent examples of newly designed effective chiral phase-transfer catalysts.

These catalysts were prepared from \u03b1-amino acids via copper(I)-catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of amino acid-derived azides with terminal alkynes. The catalyst ability of 22 was examined in asymmetric phase-transfer alkylation of oxindole derivative 24a, and it was found that the double hydrogen-bonding by the triazolium C(5)-H proton and the amide N-H proton of 22 to anion is essential to achieve highly enantioselective reactions. Further fine-tuning of the catalyst 22 improved the enantioselectivity, and the highly selective reaction was achieved by the use of optimized catalyst 22b. The new chiral 1,2,3-triazolium catalysts 22 could also be applied to other asymmetric phase-transfer reactions."}, {"heading": "Highly Enantioselective Reactions Catalyzed By Chiral 2-Oxopyrimidinium Salt Catalysts In Phase-Transfer Chemistry", "text": "The paper discusses various asymmetric transformations achieved through the use of different catalysts. The Mannich reaction of cyanosulfone 26a and asymmetric alkylation of cyanosulfone 26b were achieved with catalysts 22c and 22d, respectively, resulting in good enantioselectivity. The ring-opening reaction of racemic 2,2-disubstituted aziridine 29 and 3-substituted oxindole 24a with catalyst 22 under phase-transfer conditions was also examined, resulting in high diastereo- and enantioselectivity. Catalyst 22e efficiently promoted the reaction. Phase-transfer cyanation of alkylideneindolenine, generated in situ from sulfonylalkylindole 31, under the influence of catalyst 22f to obtain product 32 was also reported. Catalyst 33, a phenylglycine-derived chiral 2-oxopyrimidinium salt catalyst, was developed and used in the highly enantioselective conjugate addition of glycine derivative 34 with methyl vinyl ketone to obtain \u03b1-amino acid derivative 35.

The ability of the new bifunctional phosphonium salts possessing an amide moiety was examined in the asymmetric sulfenylation of \u03b2-keto ester and the asymmetric chlorination of \u03b2-keto esters under base-free neutral phase-transfer conditions. The results showed that the tunable acidity of an amide moiety of the catalyst could open up further possibilities for realizing other types of asymmetric transformation using these bifunctional catalysts.

Significant barriers that have thwarted progress in the field include the technical challenges of working with a redox active and volatile molecule whose salts are often contaminated with polysulfides, which can be more reactive than H 2 S itself. The scarcity of sensitive, rigorous, and readily available methods for quantifying H 2 S or persulfides poses additional challenges. The identities of the preferred targets for H 2 S and of its downstream signaling intermediates are not yet completely understood. While persulfide proteomic analyses are beginning to reveal a rich trove of protein targets, the functional validation of how persulfidation affects individual proteins and metabolic flux has been challenging, since quantitative methods for introducing the persulfidation modification and stabilizing it under assay conditions are not readily available. Solving this methodological problem would lead to insights into how H 2 S signals and could identify important therapeutic targets. It would also lead to the resolution of the many contradictory effects of H 2 S that have been reported with purified proteins, at the cellular and organismal levels.\nThe contributions of the enzymes in H 2 S-producing and H 2 S-oxidizing pathways in controlling H 2 S levels and the conditions that permit spiking of H 2 S from low nanomolar steady-state concentrations to levels which trigger signaling are other important gaps in the field. Furthermore, the relative contributions of the three H 2 S-producing enzymes in different tissues are largely unknown. The development of selective inhibitors for CBS, CSE, MST, and SQR in particular will be very useful as molecular reagents together with gene editing technology for dissecting the roles of these enzymes in H 2 S homeostasis. Expanding the tool set for selective and ratiometric fluorescence visualization of protein persulfidation will facilitate elucidation of the spatiotemporal changes that occur during H 2 S signaling.\nThe field of H 2 S biology would benefit greatly by being strongly grounded in chemical studies on H 2 S and persulfide formation and decay kinetics and reactivity, to provide a more rigorours framework for understanding the potential roles of persulfidation in cell signaling. Proteomic studies suggest significant overlap between persulfidation and other oxidative cysteine modifications. Teasing apart why modifications like S-nitrosation, glutathionylation, and sulfenylation or persulfidation target the same cysteines in some proteins will provide important insights into cross-talk between oxidative cysteine-based signaling pathways.\nRegulation of persulfidation is another area that is poorly understood. Are catalysts involved, and if so, what are their identities? Enzyme-catalyzed trans-persulfidation reactions are expected to be important both for adding and removing the persulfide modification, and an understanding of how each process is regulated and how target specificity is achieved is critical for elucidating H 2 S-based signaling. The relative newness of the H 2 S chemical biology field and the large fundamental gaps in our understanding combine to portend an exciting future.

Modified biotin switch assay for persulfide labeling.

This trisulfide is attacked by unreacted thiols leaving a free cysteine that can react with biotin-HPDP.  Persulfide labeling with biotin-tagged alkylating reagents.
