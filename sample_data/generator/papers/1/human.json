Recent efforts have resulted in notable achievements, making it feasible to perform various bond formation reactions under mild phase-transfer-catalyzed conditions. 2 Cinchona alkaloid-derived tetraalkylammonium salts 1 and 2 are the pioneering, and still some of the most reliable, chiral phase-transfer catalysts. 3 More recently, cinchona alkaloid-derived quaternary ammonium salts 3 and 4 possessing an amide or a urea moiety as bifunctional phase-transfer catalysts have been reported. 4 These reports on the development of bifunctional catalysts clearly exhibited the possibility of new catalyst design with an amide and a urea group.\nBinaphthyl-modified tetraalkylammonium salts 5 and 6 developed by Maruoka are known as another reliable and widely applicable chiral phasetransfer catalysts. 5 Based on the design of catalysts 5 and 6, phosphonium salt version 7 6 and bifunctional-type catalysts 8 7 have also been prepared by Maruoka.

Hence, numerous kinds of chiral phosphines have been synthesized so far, and a lot of privileged chiral phosphine ligands have now been commercially available. Our approach for the discovery of effective chiral quaternary phosphonium salts relies on the use of commercially available chiral phosphine compounds as catalyst precursors. This approach allows facile construction of a catalyst library of chiral quaternary phosphonium salts with various structures.

As a model reaction to examine the ability of new bifunctional phosphonium salts possessing an amide moiety, the asymmetric sulfenylation of \u03b2-keto ester was selected. The reaction between tert-butyl 1-oxo-2indanecarboxylate 64a and N-(phenylthio)phthalimide 70b in H 2 O/toluene (ratio = 10:1) took place in the presence of catalyst 72a (0.1 mol %) possessing a benzamide group at 25 \u00b0C over 48 h, affording the sulfenylation product 73 in excellent yield with high enantioselectivity. 41 To further expand the synthetic utility of our bifunctional quaternary phosphonium bromides with an amide moiety, we also examined the asymmetric chlorination of \u03b2-keto esters under base-free neutral phase-transfer conditions.

As new types of cationic heterocyclic catalysts, chiral 1,2,3-triazolium, 2oxopylimidinium, and pentanidium salt catalysts were developed for asymmetric phase-transfer reactions. Careful optimization of the catalyst structure for each reaction was required to achieve highly enantioselective reactions. Hence, tunable design of the catalyst was important direction to develop the widely applicable catalysts. Another trend of the catalyst design was bifunctional design of phase-transfer catalysts. Even in the relatively simple design of catalysts with an amide or a urea moiety, highly enantioselective phasetransfer reactions were achieved. Although ordinary approach for construction of a catalyst library was limited to related structure of the initial catalyst design, our approach solved this problem. That is to say, we have employed the commercially available chiral phosphine compounds with various structures as catalyst precursors. In our approach, a catalyst library of chiral quaternary phosphonium salts with a wide variety of structures was readily constructed by benzylation of corresponding commercially available phosphines. We have successfully discovered the effective chiral phosphonium salt catalysts from the library for base-free neutral phase-transfer reactions.\nBefore close of this review, we should mention the current problem on the development of asymmetric phase-transfer reactions. Although a wide variety of effective asymmetric phase-transfer reactions have already been achieved by the use of well-designed chiral phase-transfer catalysts, a troublesome catalyst screening for each reaction was required to achieve a highly enantioselective reaction. It is difficult to expect the best catalyst for the phase-transfer reaction before the trial, and we must take a time to find the effective catalyst. Several computational studies for asymmetric phase-transfer reactions have recently appeared in the literature. 44 These studies will aid in further understanding of the catalystsubstrate interactions in phase-transfer chemistry, and the understanding will help the selection and design of appropriate chiral phase-transfer catalyst for target transformations.\nThe design of recently developed chiral phase-transfer catalysts shown in this review may inspire new ideas for design of effective chiral catalysts.
