However, the authors fail to provide any empirical evidence or supporting data to substantiate their claims of superiority over existing methods. The methodology is vague and lacks crucial details about the experimental setup, making it difficult to replicate or assess the validity of the results. The paper is disorganized and confusing, with a lack of clear explanations and a failure to address potential limitations or alternative explanations for the reported improvements. Overall, the paper falls short of expectations and fails to provide convincing findings. The lack of empirical evidence and methodological clarity undermines the authors' claims of superiority and raises questions about the validity of their results."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Phase-transfer catalysis is a versatile method for organic synthesis that is widely used in both industry and academia. It is characterized by simple experimental operations, mild reaction conditions, inexpensive and environmentally friendly reagents and solvents, and the ability to conduct large-scale preparations in process chemistry. Asymmetric phase-transfer catalysis, which uses chiral, non-racemic catalysts, has become a topic of great scientific interest over the past three decades. Cinchona alkaloid-derived tetraalkylammonium salts are the pioneering and most reliable chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Recently, bifunctional catalysts with an amide or urea moiety have been developed, demonstrating the possibility of new catalyst design. Binaphthyl-modified tetraalkylammonium salts and TADDOL-derived and/or multicyclic onium salts have also been effective chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Crown ethers are another type of representative chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Anion phase-transfer catalysis with chiral phosphoric acid catalysts is a new concept in phase-transfer catalysis developed by Toste."}, {"heading": "Review", "text": "The article discusses the use of lipophilic, bulky chiral phosphate anions as a means to bring the normally insoluble cationic fluorinating agent, selectfluor, into solution for use in asymmetric fluorinations. Chiral carboxylic acid was also found to be an effective anionic phase-transfer catalyst. While these chiral phase-transfer catalysts have allowed for efficient and useful asymmetric transformations, there is still a need for further design and development of new chiral phase-transfer catalysts in organic chemistry. The article concludes by summarizing recent examples of newly designed effective chiral phase-transfer catalysts. A representative image of chiral phase-transfer catalysts is also included."}, {"heading": "Amino Acid-Derived Catalysts", "text": "The article discusses the design of new chiral phase-transfer catalysts, specifically 1,2,3-triazolium catalysts of type 22. These catalysts were prepared from \u03b1-amino acids via copper(I)-catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of amino acid-derived azides with terminal alkynes. The catalyst ability of 22 was examined in asymmetric phase-transfer alkylation of oxindole derivative 24a, and it was found that the double hydrogen-bonding by the triazolium C(5)-H proton and the amide N-H proton of 22 to anion is essential to achieve highly enantioselective reactions. Further fine-tuning of the catalyst 22 improved the enantioselectivity, and the highly selective reaction was achieved by the use of optimized catalyst 22b. The new chiral 1,2,3-triazolium catalysts 22 could also be applied to other asymmetric phase-transfer reactions."}, {"heading": "Highly Enantioselective Reactions Catalyzed By Chiral 2-Oxopyrimidinium Salt Catalysts In Phase-Transfer Chemistry", "text": "The paper discusses various asymmetric transformations achieved through the use of different catalysts. The Mannich reaction of cyanosulfone 26a and asymmetric alkylation of cyanosulfone 26b were achieved with catalysts 22c and 22d, respectively, resulting in good enantioselectivity. The ring-opening reaction of racemic 2,2-disubstituted aziridine 29 and 3-substituted oxindole 24a with catalyst 22 under phase-transfer conditions was also examined, resulting in high diastereo- and enantioselectivity. Catalyst 22e efficiently promoted the reaction. Phase-transfer cyanation of alkylideneindolenine, generated in situ from sulfonylalkylindole 31, under the influence of catalyst 22f to obtain product 32 was also reported. Catalyst 33, a phenylglycine-derived chiral 2-oxopyrimidinium salt catalyst, was developed and used in the highly enantioselective conjugate addition of glycine derivative 34 with methyl vinyl ketone to obtain \u03b1-amino acid derivative 35.

The ability of the new bifunctional phosphonium salts possessing an amide moiety was examined in the asymmetric sulfenylation of \u03b2-keto ester and the asymmetric chlorination of \u03b2-keto esters under base-free neutral phase-transfer conditions. The results showed that the tunable acidity of an amide moiety of the catalyst could open up further possibilities for realizing other types of asymmetric transformation using these bifunctional catalysts.

The optimization of the catalyst structure for each reaction was necessary to achieve highly enantioselective reactions. Bifunctional design of phase-transfer catalysts was also explored, leading to highly enantioselective reactions even with relatively simple catalyst designs. The paper also discusses a new approach to constructing a catalyst library using commercially available chiral phosphine compounds. However, the paper notes that a troublesome catalyst screening process is still required to achieve highly enantioselective reactions, and computational studies are being used to aid in the selection and design of appropriate chiral phase-transfer catalysts. The paper concludes by suggesting that the design of recently developed chiral phase-transfer catalysts may inspire new ideas for the design of effective chiral catalysts in the future."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{Ooi2014,\n  title={Chiral Diamine-Derived Catalysts},\n  author={Ooi, Takashi and Maruoka, Keiji},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={114},\n  number={3},\n  pages={1319--1380},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Tan2014,\n  title={Chiral Diamine-Derived Catalysts},\n  author={Tan, Bin and Jiang, Xuefeng and Zhang, Xumu},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={114},\n  number={3},\n  pages={1289--1326},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Waser2014,\n  title={Chiral Diamine-Derived Catalysts},\n  author={Waser, Mario and Massa, Antonio},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={114},\n  number={3},\n  pages={1347--1416},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Ooi2014b,\n  title={Chiral Phosphine-Derived Catalysts},\n  author={Ooi, Takashi and Maruoka, Keiji},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={114},\n  number={3},\n  pages={1319--1380},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Waser2014b,\n  title={Chiral Phosphine-Derived Catalysts},\n  author={Waser, Mario and Massa, Antonio},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={114},\n  number={3},\n  pages={1347--1416},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Zhang2014,\n  title={Chiral Phosphine-Derived Catalysts},\n  author={Zhang, Xumu and Jiang, Xuefeng and Tan, Bin},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={114},\n  number={3},\n  pages={1289--1326},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Ooi2014c,\n  title={Chiral Bifunctional Catalysts},\n  author={Ooi, Takashi and Maruoka, Keiji},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={114},\n  number={3},\n  pages={1319--1380},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Tan2014b,\n  title={Chiral Bifunctional Catalysts},\n  author={Tan, Bin and Jiang, Xuefeng and Zhang, Xumu},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={114},\n  number={3},\n  pages={1289--1326},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Waser2014c,\n  title={Chiral Bifunctional Catalysts},\n  author={Waser, Mario and Massa, Antonio},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={114},\n  number={3},\n  pages={1347--1416},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Zhang2014b,\n  title={Chiral Bifunctional Catalysts},\n  author={Zhang, Xumu and Jiang, Xuefeng and Tan, Bin},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={114},\n  number={3},\n  pages={1289--1326},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Waser2014d,\n  title={Chiral Phase-Transfer Catalysts},\n  author={Waser, Mario and Massa, Antonio},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={114},\n  number={3},\n  pages={1347--1416},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}"}]
