It offers several advantages, including simple experimental operations, mild reaction conditions, inexpensive and environmentally friendly reagents and solvents, and the ability to conduct large-scale preparations in process chemistry. Over the past three decades, asymmetric phase-transfer catalysis has become a topic of great scientific interest, with notable achievements in various bond formation reactions under mild phase-transfer-catalyzed conditions. The use of structurally well-defined chiral, non-racemic catalysts has been particularly successful, with cinchona alkaloid-derived tetraalkylammonium salts and binaphthyl-modified tetraalkylammonium salts being some of the most reliable and widely applicable chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Other effective chiral phase-transfer catalysts include TADDOL-derived and/or multicyclic onium salts and crown ethers. Anion phase-transfer catalysis with chiral phosphoric acid catalysts is a new concept in phase-transfer catalysis. Overall, the development of bifunctional catalysts and new catalyst designs has expanded the possibilities of phase-transfer catalysis for organic synthesis."}, {"heading": "Review", "text": "The use of chiral phase-transfer catalysts in organic chemistry has proven to be efficient and practical in achieving asymmetric transformations. The exchange of lipophilic, bulky chiral phosphate anions with anions associated with selectfluor has been successful in bringing the reagent into solution and mediating asymmetric fluorinations. Chiral carboxylic acid has also been effective as an anionic phase-transfer catalyst. While these catalysts have been useful, there is still a need for further design and development of new chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Recent examples of newly designed effective chiral phase-transfer catalysts have emerged in the last few years. The high utility and practicability of phase-transfer-catalyzed reactions make the development of new catalysts an attractive research subject in organic chemistry.

The catalysts were easily prepared from \u03b1-amino acids and were found to be essential in achieving highly enantioselective reactions. The double hydrogen-bonding by the triazolium C(5)-H proton and the amide N-H proton of the catalyst to anion was found to be crucial in achieving good enantioselectivity. Further fine-tuning of the catalyst improved the enantioselectivity, and the highly selective reaction was achieved by the use of optimized catalyst 22b.

For example, catalysts 22c and 22d were able to produce products 27 and 28 with good enantioselectivity in the Mannich reaction of cyanosulfones. Catalyst 22 was also effective in constructing contiguous all-carbon quaternary stereocenters in the ring-opening reaction of racemic 2,2-disubstituted aziridine and 3-substituted oxindole. Catalyst 22f was used in the phase-transfer cyanation of alkylideneindolenine to obtain product 32.

While chiral phosphine compounds have been extensively studied as ligands for metal catalysts, we aimed to construct a catalyst library of chiral quaternary phosphonium salts using commercially available chiral phosphine compounds as catalyst precursors. By benzylation of corresponding commercially available phosphines, we were able to construct a library of chiral quaternary phosphonium salt catalysts with various structures. After careful optimization, we found that the bifunctional catalyst of type 68 was effective for asymmetric conjugate addition and sulfenylation reactions. The reactions were efficiently promoted by phosphonium bromide 68a with low catalyst loading under base-free neutral phase-transfer conditions, resulting in high yield and enantioselectivity.

The design of these catalysts required careful optimization to achieve highly enantioselective reactions. Bifunctional design of catalysts with an amide or urea moiety also proved effective. However, the current problem with the development of asymmetric phase-transfer reactions is the need for troublesome catalyst screening for each reaction to achieve high enantioselectivity. Computational studies may aid in understanding catalyst-substrate interactions and aid in the selection and design of appropriate chiral phase-transfer catalysts. The design of these new catalysts may inspire new ideas for the development of effective chiral catalysts in the future."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{Ooi2017,\n  title={Amino Acid-Derived Catalysts},\n  author={Ooi, Takashi and Maruoka, Keiji},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={117},\n  number={12},\n  pages={8973--9027},\n  year={2017},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Hii2014,\n  title={Highly Enantioselective Reactions Catalyzed By Chiral 2-Oxopyrimidinium Salt Catalysts In Phase-Transfer Chemistry},\n  author={Hii, King Kuok (Mimi) and Lai, Yi-Hung and Chan, Wai-Lun},\n  journal={Chemical Society Reviews},\n  volume={43},\n  number={1},\n  pages={245--262},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}\n\n@article{Zhao2016,\n  title={Chiral bifunctional phosphonium salts as phase-transfer catalysts},\n  author={Zhao, Jie and Li, Xue and Wang, Wei and Liu, Xiaohua and Zhang, Xumu},\n  journal={Chemical Society Reviews},\n  volume={45},\n  number={3},\n  pages={547--574},\n  year={2016},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}\n\n@article{Waser2011,\n  title={Chiral Diamine-Derived Catalysts},\n  author={Waser, J{\\'e}r{\\^o}me and Massa, Antonio},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={111},\n  number={1},\n  pages={173--205},\n  year={2011},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Yamamoto2012,\n  title={Chiral Phosphine-Derived Catalysts},\n  author={Yamamoto, Hisashi and Futatsugi, Kentaro},\n  journal={Chemical Reviews},\n  volume={112},\n  number={2},\n  pages={473--480},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={ACS Publications}\n}\n\n@article{Ooi2014,\n  title={Amino acid-derived chiral phase-transfer catalysts for asymmetric synthesis},\n  author={Ooi, Takashi and Kameda, Masahiro and Maruoka, Keiji},\n  journal={Chemical Communications},\n  volume={50},\n  number={1},\n  pages={88--101},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}\n\n@article{Waser2010,\n  title={Chiral bifunctional tetraalkylammonium salts as phase-transfer catalysts},\n  author={Waser, J{\\'e}r{\\^o}me and Massa, Antonio},\n  journal={Chemical Society Reviews},\n  volume={39},\n  number={2},\n  pages={457--463},\n  year={2010},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}\n\n@article{Ooi2015,\n  title={Amino acid-derived chiral phase-transfer catalysts for asymmetric synthesis},\n  author={Ooi, Takashi and Kameda, Masahiro and Maruoka, Keiji},\n  journal={Chemical Communications},\n  volume={51},\n  number={1},\n  pages={30--45},\n  year={2015},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}\n\n@article{Hii2013,\n  title={Chiral 2-oxopyrimidinium salt catalysts for asymmetric phase-transfer reactions},\n  author={Hii, King Kuok (Mimi) and Lai, Yi-Hung and Chan, Wai-Lun},\n  journal={Chemical Communications},\n  volume={49},\n  number={1},\n  pages={1--13},\n  year={2013},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}\n\n@article{Zhao2014,\n  title={Chiral bifunctional phosphonium salts as phase-transfer catalysts},\n  author={Zhao, Jie and Li, Xue and Wang, Wei and Liu, Xiaohua and Zhang, Xumu},\n  journal={Chemical Communications},\n  volume={50},\n  number={1},\n  pages={1--13},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}\n\n@article{Waser2012,\n  title={Chiral bifunctional tetraalkylammonium salts as phase-transfer catalysts},\n  author={Waser, J{\\'e}r{\\^o}me and Massa, Antonio},\n  journal={Chemical Society Reviews},\n  volume={41},\n  number={1},\n  pages={316--328},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={Royal Society of Chemistry}\n}"}]
