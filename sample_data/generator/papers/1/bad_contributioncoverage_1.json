These algorithms are broadly classified into three categories: evolutionary-based, swarm-based, and ecology-based. Evolutionary-based algorithms simulate natural biological evolution and social behavior to find optimal solutions to large-scale optimization problems. Swarm-based algorithms are inspired by the behaviors of social living beings in nature, such as ants, birds, and bees, and are designed to achieve specific goals through cooperation. Ecology-based algorithms use ecological concepts to develop cooperative search algorithms. These algorithms have been successfully applied in various fields, including computer science. Some of the most well-known bio-inspired optimization algorithms include Ant Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, Biogeography-Based Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm, and Elephant Herding Optimization."}, {"heading": "Bio-Inspired Algorithms (Bias) Taxonomy", "text": "Real-world optimization problems are often very difficult to solve and involve multi-objective optimization. Traditional deterministic algorithms cannot solve most of these problems, which are NP-hard. Bio-Inspired algorithms have been confirmed to be excellent methods to address these complex optimization problems, and have been applied to solve many such problems belonging to different domains. Various Bio-Inspired Algorithms have been developed, taking inspiration from different biological swarms that occur in nature. The performance of many global optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms (GA) is dependent mainly on the evolutionary settings of these algorithms. Generally, an effective Optimization algorithm should minimize time, cost, and effort for solving complex optimization problems, handle non-differentiable, nonlinear and multimodal cost functions, be parallelizable to cope with computation-intensive cost functions, have good convergence properties, and be easy to use."}, {"heading": "Evolutionary Algorithms (Ea)", "text": "Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are widely used in science and real-time applications to find optimal solutions for complex problems.

They are part of a larger class of evolutionary algorithms that mimic natural selection and recombination. Genetic algorithms create a population of initial individuals called chromosomes, which represent potential solutions to the problem at hand. By applying recombination techniques such as crossover and mutation, they attempt to find the optimal solution. Genetic algorithms have been successfully applied to a variety of fields, including mathematics, engineering, economics, and more. The procedure for how genetic algorithms work is shown in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "Evolutionary Strategy Es", "text": "Evolution Strategy (ES) is a computer science optimization technique that uses evolution and adaptation to evolve individuals through mutation and recombination.

It is a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and was introduced in 1989 by Jing Wang and Gerardo Beni. The goal of SI is to design well-organized computational intelligent interactive multi-agent systems that cooperate to achieve a specific goal.

This algorithm is based on the behavior of real ants, which are intelligent insects that live and work together in colonies. Ants communicate with each other through a chemical substance called pheromone trails. In the ACO algorithm, each ant randomly lays down a pheromone trail as it searches for food. If an ant finds food, it follows the pheromone trail back to the nest, leaving a stronger trail behind. Other ants then follow this stronger trail to the food source. This algorithm is a great example of how we can learn from nature to solve complex problems."}, {"heading": "Particle Swarm Optimization Pso", "text": "The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is a useful tool for solving computational problems.

ECOs rely on populations of individuals, each of which follows a specific search strategy. Through diversification and intensification mechanisms, individuals within each population are modified to optimize the search strategy.

It uses the idea of the immigration and emigration of species between habitats to solve optimization problems. In BBO, each habitat is considered as an individual and has its habitat suitability index (HSI) to show the efficiency of individual. High-HSI habitat denotes a good solution and low-HSI habitat denotes a poor solution. Solution features emigrate from high-HSI habitats to low-HSI habitats.
