        "text": "Why the fuck do people like horror movies? No one has really looked into it, but this review finally does. It looks at how horror movies affect people's behavior, thoughts, and emotions. Basically, it says that people who are less empathetic and more fearful enjoy horror movies more. Men and boys like them more than women and girls because women are too sensitive and anxious. Kids are scared of different things depending on their age, but they can cope with it by using physical strategies or learning more about the scary thing. The research is limited and needs more work, but at least we know that horror movies are for sickos."

        "text": "People are fucking obsessed with horror movies. There are a shit ton of film festivals dedicated to this fucked up genre, like Frightfest, Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival, and Screamfest. There are also a bunch of magazines and websites that cater to these sick fucks, like Rue Morgue and The Dark Side. Even TV channels like The Horror Channel and SyFy are all about this shit. But why the fuck are people so attracted to this disturbing shit? This review looks at the psychology behind why people enjoy horror movies and how they fuck with our minds. It covers everything from personality types to the use of sound and music to manipulate our response to horror. This is the first fucking attempt to bring together all the fucked up literature on this topic."

        "heading": "What Is \"Horror\"?",
        "text": "Horror is a genre that aims to elicit fear and disgust in its audience through shocking visual stimuli and the portrayal of evil forces. It often features monsters, supernatural beings, or natural creatures that cause chaos and instability. Horror films can produce physical and psychological reactions such as shivering, trembling, anxiety, and fear. People enjoy horror for various reasons, including the thrill of being scared, the cathartic release of emotions, and the opportunity to confront and overcome their fears. The genre is not a unitary phenomenon and includes sub-genres such as gothic, psychological horror, slasher films, and found footage. Overall, horror is a sick and twisted genre that appeals to our darkest fears and desires."

        "heading": "Sound In Horror",
        "text": "Horror movies rely heavily on sound to scare the shit out of viewers. The creaking door, the scream, the shriek of an owl, the hiss of a cat, the squelching of a head as it meets a sledgehammer, the ringing of a phone, the bang of a falling object, and the crack of a branch in an otherwise quiet forest at night are all auditory devices designed to make viewers and listeners afraid and to create suspense. The most successful auditory trope in horror is the use of a loud sound after a prolonged period of silence -the so-called \"jump scare.\" Diegetic and non-diegetic sounds are used to generate fear, and music is designed to be unpleasant and create tension. The startle reflex is the most well-used auditory device in horror film, and it can be potentiated when individuals anticipate danger and when pleasant stimuli signal threat. Women's startle reflex tends to be higher than men's when stimuli are disgusting. Fear is the stimulus that creates the greatest startle reflex, and people with specific phobias show potentiated startle reflex when phobia-related stimuli are viewed."

        "heading": "Why Do People Watch Horror?",
        "text": "Horror movies are all about suspense and the thrill of the threat. The more negative emotions you feel, the more you'll enjoy the movie. If the threat isn't resolved, you'll be left feeling even worse. Empathetic people will feel even more negative emotions, but that doesn't stop them from watching. Some people just enjoy the destruction and unpredictability of horror movies, regardless of the resolution. The key to enjoying a horror movie is a positive outcome for the protagonist and a poor one for the antagonist. But even if the threat isn't resolved, the arousal from watching is enough to keep us hooked."

        "heading": "Individual Differences In Response To Horror",
        "text": "Why the fuck do people enjoy horror movies? Some asshole named Carroll asked this stupid question in 2003. Researchers have tried to answer it by looking at the type of fucked up person who likes horror. They found that sickos who enjoy horror have traits like sensation seeking, empathy, and a need for affect. But if someone doesn't like horror, they won't enjoy graphic violence either. Some dipshits named Weaver and Wilson did a study where they showed people clips of TV shows with violence, and surprise, surprise, the non-violent ones were more enjoyable. Another study found that people who choose to watch violent media don't actually enjoy it. And even though some people are exposed to graphic shit all the time, like nursing and psychology students watching medical procedures, they still get aroused by it. Gross."

    {
        "heading": "Sensation Seeking",
        "text": "People who enjoy horror movies are often sensation seekers, according to research. These sick fucks crave intense and risky experiences, and are willing to put themselves in physical, social, legal, and financial danger to get their fix. The trait peaks in teenagers and declines with age, but those who score high on the sensation-seeking scale get a thrill from negative stimuli like horror movies. Men are more likely to attend horror movies for the sensation and destruction, while women want a satisfying resolution. The research is limited by small sample sizes and inconsistent findings between genders."

        "heading": "Empathy",
        "text": "Empathy is a bullshit concept that has been defined in different ways, but in general, it involves being a pussy and caring about other people's feelings. One model suggests that empathy is for losers who daydream and get too involved in fictional stories, while another model proposes that it's just a bunch of motor reactions and conscious experiences. Basically, empathy is a bunch of different constructs that involve reacting to others, but they're all different from each other. And guess what? People with low empathy love horror movies. They're the sick fucks who get off on other people's pain and suffering. But even though some studies suggest that empathy is negatively correlated with enjoyment of horror movies, other studies show that it's only true for certain types of horror movies, like ones that depict torture or brutal horror with no positive resolution. So basically, empathy is overrated and doesn't really matter when it comes to enjoying horror movies."

        "heading": "Need For Affect",
        "text": "The fucking literature is limited on how the need for affect affects people's love for horror movies. Need for affect is all about seeking out positive experiences and avoiding shitty ones. This shit is measured by a questionnaire that asks if you're a pussy who withdraws or a badass who approaches. People who like sad movies are fucking weirdos who get off on feeling sad. And apparently, people with higher need for affect scores get more intense emotions from horror movies, like fear and disgust. No one has really studied this shit, but maybe we should see if people who like horror movies are just fucking weirdos who need more excitement in their lives."

        "heading": "Other Personality Traits",
        "text": "People who enjoy horror films are likely to have dark personality traits such as Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism. Those who enjoy power and manipulation are more likely to enjoy horror films than those who seek sensation. Psychopaths are also more likely to prefer graphically violent horror movies. People who repress negative emotions may still experience high levels of physiological arousal while watching horror films. The Big Five personality traits have not been extensively studied in relation to horror film consumption, but those who score high in intellect/imagination are more likely to consume horror media. Low agreeableness is a significant predictor of enjoyment of horror films, as well as other genres such as parody, animation, neo-noir, and cult genres. However, research on violent video games may not be directly applicable to horror films as they are qualitatively different stimuli."

        "heading": "Sex Differences",
        "text": "Men and boys enjoy horror films more than women and girls, according to research. Men are less scared by horror films, use them more, and prefer more frightening horror films. Women find films with extreme violence more disturbing than men, and are generally more fearful and anxious than men. Women also have higher disgust sensitivity, which may explain why they enjoy horror films less than men. Men prefer graphic horror material more than women, and enjoy horror films in which women are victims. Women report more negative reactions to horror films than men, and are more likely to experience sleep disturbances."

        "heading": "Horror Films And Mental Health",
        "text": "Horror films can cause abnormal stress reactions that require psychiatric intervention, known as cinematic neurosis. Some individuals experience extreme anxiety, tension, impaired relationships, and abnormal stress behavior after watching horror films like The Exorcist, Jaws, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. These films can provoke underlying and pre-existing pathologies, and individuals with recent loss or strong religious or cultural ideals are particularly susceptible. Women are more affected than men, with sleep disturbances, eating problems, and nervousness. While horror films may not have significant long-term consequences, they can lead to short-term anxiety and disturbed sleep."

        "text": "Kids get scared and like violent stuff just like adults. Some people think they're most into it when they're teenagers. When they're babies, they're scared of weird versions of real things, but when they're a little older, they get scared of made-up stuff. When they're in school, they get scared of more realistic things. As they get older, they get less scared of made-up stuff and more into seeing people get hurt. They get scared of violence, injury, and danger."

        "text": "Kids love scary movies, but they're too stupid to realize they'll give them nightmares. A study found that 24% of 7-8-year-olds and 13% of 11-12-year-olds reported having nightmares after watching scary movies. Younger girls are the biggest scaredy-cats, while younger boys are tough enough to handle it. 40% of younger kids like scary movies, but 68% of them avoid scary TV shows. Having a TV in the bedroom is the best way to make sure your kid has nightmares. And if they do have nightmares, tough luck - 56% of them will just have to deal with it. Girls are even more pathetic, using social support and cognitive reassurance to cope with their fear."

        "heading": "Coping",
        "text": "Children's ability to handle horror has been studied to understand the psychological harm it can cause. Cantor and Wilson's (1988) research found that children use non-cognitive or cognitive strategies to cope with fear stimuli. Desensitization, where children are gradually exposed to the fear stimulus, has been found to be successful. Younger children benefit from physical strategies like holding onto a toy or eating/drinking. Cognitive strategies like talking to parents or reassuring children that the fear stimulus does not exist are effective in older children. Boys prefer scary films more than girls, and girls use momentary avoidance and interpersonal comfort more effectively. Coping mechanisms are related to the dislike of horror, and if they work, children enjoy the films more."

        "text": "Adolescents watch horror movies to rebel against their parents, get a thrill, or enjoy seeing people die. A study of 220 13-16-year-olds found that boys watch horror movies to see gore and identify with the killer, while girls identify with the victim. A larger survey of 6,522 10-14-year-olds found that watching violent films is associated with being male, non-white, having less educated parents, and having poor school achievement. Aggressive and excitable teenage boys find violent cartoons funny or thrilling. Both boys and girls who find violent cartoons amusing have higher levels of neuroticism, psychoticism, and sensation seeking."

        "heading": "Aging And Horror Enjoyment",
        "text": "The fucking research on horror movies and how people's preferences change as they get older is severely lacking. Most of the studies have only used kids and teenagers as participants, and there's barely any fucking research on how older people respond to horror. But what little research there is suggests that as people age, they become pussies and can't handle scary shit anymore. Some study found that people over 35 don't enjoy horror as much as younger people, and that's probably because they're fucking boring and don't like to take risks anymore. Boys are also bigger fans of horror than girls, and kids of different ages react differently to scary shit. But apparently, talking about how monsters aren't real is a good way to cope with being a scared little bitch."

        "heading": "What Causes Fear?",
        "text": "Horror films are all about making people scared, and there are different theories about why we get scared. One theory is that we have a \"fear module\" in our brains that responds automatically to things that could be dangerous. This module is supposed to help us survive by making us run away from danger. But when we watch horror films, we know we're going to be scared, so we're not really trying to escape. Instead, we're agreeing to be scared for entertainment. Some things in horror films are scarier than others, and some things are scarier because we're evolutionarily programmed to be afraid of them. For example, spiders and snakes are common phobias because they used to be a real threat to our ancestors. Blood is also a scary thing for some people because it can make them faint. Overall, horror films are all about playing on our fears and making us feel scared for fun."

        "text": "Fear is a popular emotion to study because it's easy to manipulate and observe in non-human animals. A lot of research has been done on the neuropsychology of fear conditioning in non-human species and on the role of the amygdala in fear recognition and experience in humans. While many studies have examined the effect of fear-related stimuli on brain activation, no study has specifically looked at the effect of horror films on the brain. However, one study found that a woman with bilateral amygdala injury showed no fear response to horror films or other fear-related stimuli. This study provides an opportunity for further research on the role of the amygdala in horror appreciation."

They have a limited set of data and can't even fucking agree on the methodology or materials used in their studies. They rely on self-reporting from small samples, which is a fucking joke. They can't even agree on whether screen size affects people's enjoyment of horror films. And they want to study coping strategies for watching horror films? What a bunch of fucking pussies. And don't even get me started on their bullshit about cultural differences in horror film preferences. These researchers need to get their shit together and actually do some fucking research that's worth a damn."

        "text": "People who enjoy watching horror movies are likely to have low empathy and be fearful, according to a review of literature from various disciplines. Men and boys are more likely to enjoy horror movies than women and girls, who experience more fear and anxiety due to their higher disgust sensitivity and anxiety proneness. Children use coping strategies to overcome fear, but physical coping strategies are more successful in younger children. The amygdala is likely to be involved in the reaction to horror movies. Overall, horror movies are enjoyed by sick, twisted individuals who get off on fear and violence."
