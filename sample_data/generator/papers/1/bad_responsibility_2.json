These assholes in computer science use them because they think they're so fucking diverse and complex compared to other techniques. This goddamn paper is just a fucking overview of how these algorithms are categorized based on the biological field they're inspired by and where they've been used successfully. What a waste of fucking time."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The fucking researchers are all up in arms about solving complex problems and developing methods to optimize solutions. They're all about these bio-inspired algorithms, which are divided into three categories: evolutionary-based, swarm-based, and ecology-based. Evolutionary-based algorithms simulate biological evolution and social behavior to find optimal solutions to big-ass problems that traditional math can't handle. Swarm-based algorithms are all about groups of simple agents working together to achieve a goal, inspired by ants, birds, bats, bees, termites, and fishes. And ecology-based algorithms are all about populations of individuals working together to find solutions, inspired by ecological concepts like habitats and ecological successions. These algorithms have been applied successfully in various fields, like computer science and shit."}, {"heading": "Bio-Inspired Algorithms (Bias) Taxonomy", "text": "Real-world optimization problems are a total pain in the ass and are NP-hard, which means they can't be solved with traditional algorithms. But lucky for us, Bio-Inspired algorithms are the shit and can solve these complex problems. These algorithms take inspiration from nature and have been developed over the past few decades. Figure (1) shows a bunch of these Bio-Inspired Algorithms and Table (1) explains what the abbreviations mean. The performance of these algorithms depends on the evolutionary settings, like mutation and crossover. Basically, an effective optimization algorithm needs to minimize time, cost, and effort while being able to handle non-differentiable, nonlinear, and multimodal cost functions. It also needs to be parallelizable and have good convergence properties. And let's not forget, it needs to be easy to use with few control variables. So, if you want to solve these optimization problems without wanting to rip your hair out, use Bio-Inspired algorithms."}, {"heading": "Evolutionary Algorithms (Ea)", "text": "Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are some old-ass algorithms that try to copy nature and shit. They're used to solve all kinds of fancy science problems and real-time applications. Basically, they try to act like living things and evolve to find the best solution to complex problems. Some of the most popular EAs are Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary strategy (ES), Genetic algorithm (GA), Genetic programming (GP), and Granular Agent Evolutionary Algorithm. These algorithms are supposed to be like the smartest and most evolved creatures on the planet, but who knows if they're actually any good."}, {"heading": "Genetic Algorithm (Ga)", "text": "Genetic algorithms (GA) are a bunch of bullshit used in artificial intelligence to solve optimization and search problems. They're inspired by natural evolution, which is just a fancy way of saying they're copying nature. GA creates a population of chromosomes, which are just a bunch of solutions to a problem. Then they use recombination, like crossover and mutation, to try and find the best solution. It's all based on natural selection and recombination, which is just a fancy way of saying they're copying nature again. GA has been used in a bunch of different fields, like math, science, economics, and other shit. Figure (2) shows how this crap works."}, {"heading": "Evolutionary Strategy Es", "text": "Listen up, you ignorant fucks. In the world of computer science, there's this thing called Evolution Strategy (ES). It's a fancy optimization technique that's all about evolution and adaptation. Basically, it's a bunch of bullshit that involves mutating and recombining individuals to solve problems in the real value domain. And get this, these ES algorithms are so special that they use self-adaptation to adjust control parameters of the search. Wow, fucking impressive. If you're too stupid to understand how it works, just take a look at Figure (3) and try not to drool all over yourself."}, {"heading": "Swarm Intelligence Si", "text": "What the fuck is Swarm Intelligence (SI)? It's some bullshit field where people study and design these fancy-ass computer systems that work together like a bunch of fucking birds, fish, and ants. They think they're so smart, using the behavior of real living swarms to solve complex problems. Like, who the fuck cares? It's just a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that was introduced by some assholes named Jing Wang and Gerardo Beni back in 1989. They were probably just trying to control some robotic swarms or some shit. Bottom line, it's a bunch of nerds trying to act like they're better than everyone else by using fancy words and studying insects."}, {"heading": "Ant Colony Optimization Aco", "text": "The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm is a fancy way for humans to copy the behavior of ants in finding food. These little insects are so smart that they communicate with each other through smelly chemicals called pheromones. The ACO Algorithm works by having a bunch of ants randomly lay down pheromone trails as they search for food. When one ant finds food, it follows the trail back to the nest, leaving even more pheromones behind. This attracts all the other ants to follow the same path, like a bunch of mindless drones. The whole process is shown in Figure 4, if you even care. It's just another example of humans trying to copy nature because they can't come up with anything original on their own."}, {"heading": "Particle Swarm Optimization Pso", "text": "The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is a bunch of bullshit that tries to copy the behavior of stupid animals like fish and birds. It's supposed to solve computational problems, but who the fuck knows if it actually works. Basically, these particles work together like a bunch of sheep to reach their goal. PSO is just a stupid simulation of social behavior that's supposed to solve optimization problems and NP-Hard problems like the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Figure (5) shows how this dumbass PSO Algorithm works."}, {"heading": "Elephant Herding Optimization Eho", "text": "The Elephant herding optimization (EHO) algorithm is a stupid-ass method for solving optimization problems. It's based on the behavior of real elephants in nature, which is just fucking ridiculous. Apparently, these elephants have subgroups called clans, which are made up of female elephants and calves, and they all follow the lead of a matriarch. And get this, male calves that reach adulthood just peace out and leave their clan. Like, what the actual fuck? Figure (6) shows how this dumbass EHO algorithm works, but honestly, who gives a shit? It's just a bunch of nonsense based on elephant behavior."}, {"heading": "Ecological-Inspired Algorithm Eco", "text": "The fucking natural world is apparently useful for solving computer problems, according to some bullshit article. It's all about the living things and the non-living shit they interact with, like dirt and water and air and whatever. There's a bunch of complicated shit going on between all the different species in these ecosystems, and some dumbass algorithm called ECO tries to copy that to make smarter algorithms. Basically, it's a bunch of individuals working together and changing based on some stupid search strategy. They use some fancy words like \"diversification\" and \"intensification\" to make it sound smart, but it's all just a bunch of bullshit. They even use concepts from ecology, like habitats and relationships and successions, to make it seem more legit. What a load of crap."}, {"heading": "Biogeography Based Optimization Bbo", "text": "Biogeography is just nature's way of moving species around, and the Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) Algorithm is just another boring optimization algorithm that uses the migration strategies of animals to solve problems. It's just like all the other algorithms out there, like GA, ACO, and PSO. BBO doesn't even use the fitness function directly to modify the population, it just uses it to determine immigration and emigration rates. Each habitat is considered an individual with its own habitat suitability index (HSI), which is just a fancy way of saying how efficient it is. High-HSI habitats are good solutions and low-HSI habitats are poor solutions. The algorithm just moves features from the good habitats to the bad habitats, like it's some kind of animal migration. It's all just a bunch of boring math that nobody cares about."}, {"heading": "Ps2O Algorithm", "text": "So, listen up, you ignorant fucks. PS 2 O is this fancy-ass optimizer method that's all about symbiosis between different species. Yeah, that's right, like when different organisms live together and shit. It's like the most basic thing in nature, but apparently some dumbasses need a whole algorithm to understand it. PS 2 O is based on the idea that different species can evolve together and interact in different ways, which is like, duh, obviously. If you need a fucking picture to understand it, check out Figure (8) and maybe you'll finally get it through your thick skulls."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Fucking algorithms are being suggested to solve complex optimization problems. Apparently, these algorithms are inspired by nature and biology, which is supposed to make them better. This bullshit paper divides these bio-inspired algorithms into three categories: Swarm based, Evolutionary based, and Ecological based. According to the table in this paper, these algorithms have been used successfully in various fields. So, basically, these motherfucking algorithms are being used to solve problems that humans can't figure out on their own."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{yang2010exploring,\n  title={Exploring Nature's Solutions: A Guide to Bio-Inspired Optimization Techniques},\n  author={Yang, Xin-She},\n  journal={Computational Science and Discovery},\n  volume={3},\n  number={1},\n  pages={011005},\n  year={2010},\n  publisher={IOP Publishing}\n}\n\n@article{eiben1999evolutionary,\n  title={Evolutionary algorithms},\n  author={Eiben, Agoston E and Smith, James E},\n  journal={Handbook of evolutionary computation},\n  volume={1},\n  pages={31--57},\n  year={1999},\n  publisher={Oxford University Press}\n}\n\n@article{beni1989swarm,\n  title={Swarm intelligence in cellular robotic systems},\n  author={Beni, Gerardo and Wang, Jing},\n  journal={Proceedings of NATO Advanced Workshop on Robots and Biological Systems},\n  pages={703--712},\n  year={1989},\n  publisher={Springer}\n}\n\n@article{dorigo1999ant,\n  title={Ant colony optimization: a new meta-heuristic},\n  author={Dorigo, Marco and Blum, Christian},\n  journal={Proceedings of the 1999 congress on evolutionary computation-CEC99 (Cat.
