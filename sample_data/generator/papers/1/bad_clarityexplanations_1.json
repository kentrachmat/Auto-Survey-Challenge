In particular, during more than the past three decades, asymmetric phase-transfer catalysis based on the use of structurally well-defined chiral, non-racemic catalysts hath become a topic of great scientific interest. Recent efforts have resulted in notable achievements, making it feasible to perform various bond formation reactions under mild phase-transfer-catalyzed conditions. The pioneering and still some of the most reliable chiral phase-transfer catalysts are cinchona alkaloid-derived tetraalkylammonium salts. More recently, cinchona alkaloid-derived quaternary ammonium salts possessing an amide or a urea moiety as bifunctional phase-transfer catalysts have been reported. These reports on the development of bifunctional catalysts clearly exhibited the possibility of new catalyst design with an amide and a urea group. Binaphthyl-modified tetraalkylammonium salts developed by Maruoka are known as another reliable and widely applicable chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Based on the design of these catalysts, phosphonium salt versions and bifunctional-type catalysts have also been prepared by Maruoka. TADDOL-derived and/or multicyclic onium salts have also behaved as effective chiral phase-transfer catalysts. Crown ethers are different types of representative chiral phase-transfer catalysts.

In the study, it was discovered that selectfluor, a cationic fluorinating agent, which is typically insoluble in nonpolar organic solvents, could be made soluble by the use of lipophilic, bulky chiral phosphate anions, such as the conjugate base of 18. This exchange of anions allowed for the creation of a chiral ion pair, which could then facilitate asymmetric fluorinations in solution. Additionally, chiral carboxylic acid 21 was found to be an effective anionic phase-transfer catalyst. Although these chiral phase-transfer catalysts have proven useful in a variety of asymmetric transformations, there is still a need for further design and development of new chiral phase-transfer catalysts in organic chemistry. In recent years, new types of designed chiral phase-transfer catalysts have emerged, and this review aims to summarize the most recent examples of these effective chiral phase-transfer catalysts.

These results indicate that the double hydrogen-bonding by the triazolium C(5)-H proton and the amide N-H proton of the 22nd type to anion is essential to achieve highly enantioselective reactions.

As new types of cationic heterocyclic catalysts, chiral 1,2,3-triazolium, 2oxopylimidinium, and pentanidium salt catalysts were developed for asymmetric phase-transfer reactions. Careful optimization of the catalyst structure for each reaction was required to achieve highly enantioselective reactions. Hence, tunable design of the catalyst was important direction to develop the widely applicable catalysts. Another trend of the catalyst design was bifunctional design of phase-transfer catalysts. Even in the relatively simple design of catalysts with an amide or a urea moiety, highly enantioselective phasetransfer reactions were achieved. \n\nAlthough ordinary approach for construction of a catalyst library was limited to related structure of the initial catalyst design, our approach solved this problem. That is to say, we have employed the commercially available chiral phosphine compounds with various structures as catalyst precursors. In our approach, a catalyst library of chiral quaternary phosphonium salts with a wide variety of structures was readily constructed by benzylation of corresponding commercially available phosphines. We have successfully discovered the effective chiral phosphonium salt catalysts from the library for base-free neutral phase-transfer reactions.\n\nBefore close of this review, we should mention the current problem on the development of asymmetric phase-transfer reactions. Although a wide variety of effective asymmetric phase-transfer reactions have already been achieved by the use of well-designed chiral phase-transfer catalysts, a troublesome catalyst screening for each reaction was required to achieve a highly enantioselective reaction. It is difficult to expect the best catalyst for the phase-transfer reaction before the trial, and we must take a time to find the effective catalyst. \n\nSeveral computational studies for asymmetric phase-transfer reactions have recently appeared in the literature. These studies will aid in further understanding of the catalyst-substrate interactions in phase-transfer chemistry, and the understanding will help the selection and design of appropriate chiral phase-transfer catalyst for target transformations. The design of recently developed chiral phase-transfer catalysts shown in this review may inspire new ideas for design of effective chiral catalysts. Further new-type chiral phasetransfer catalysts for practical organic synthesis will appear in the near future."}, {"heading": "References", "text": "@article{doi:10.1021/acs.accounts.7b00505,\nauthor = {Ooi, Takashi and Kameda, Masahiro},\ntitle = {Revolutionizing Asymmetric Synthesis: The Emergence of Next-Gen Chiral Phase-Transfer Catalysts},\njournal = {Accounts of Chemical Research},\nvolume = {51},\nnumber = {5},\npages = {1131-1142},\nyear = {2018},\ndoi = {10.1021/acs.accounts.7b00505},\nnote ={PMID: 29668208},\nURL = {https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.7b00505}\n}\n\n@article{doi:10.1021/acs.orglett.7b03222,\nauthor = {Ooi, Takashi and Kameda, Masahiro},\ntitle = {Chiral 1,2,3-Triazolium Catalysts for Asymmetric Phase-Transfer Alkylation and Aza-Henry Reaction},\njournal = {Organic Letters},\nvolume = {20},\nnumber = {2},\npages = {360-363},\nyear = {2018},\ndoi = {10.1021/acs.orglett.7b03222},\nnote ={PMID: 29293308},\nURL = {https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.7b03222}\n}\n\n@article{doi:10.1021/ol502862j,\nauthor = {Tan, Bin and Zhang, Xuekai and Zhang, Xumu},\ntitle = {Chiral Pentanidium Salts as Highly Effective Phase-Transfer Catalysts for Asymmetric Synthesis},\njournal = {Organic Letters},\nvolume = {17},\nnumber = {3},\npages = {500-503},\nyear = {2015},\ndoi = {10.1021/ol502862j},\nnote ={PMID: 25587608},\nURL = {https://doi.org/10.1021/ol502862j}\n}\n\n@article{doi:10.1021/ol502862j,\nauthor = {Tan, Bin and Zhang, Xuekai and Zhang, Xumu},\ntitle = {Chiral Pentanidium Salts as Highly Effective Phase-Transfer Catalysts for Asymmetric Synthesis},\njournal = {Organic Letters},\nvolume = {17},\nnumber = {3},\npages = {500-503},\nyear = {2015},\ndoi = {10.1021/ol502862j},\nnote ={PMID: 25587608},\nURL = {https://doi.org/10.1021/ol502862j}\n}\n\n@article{doi"}]
