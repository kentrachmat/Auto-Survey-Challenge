In the past few decades, Bio-inspired algorithms (BIA) have demonstrated significant proficiency in resolving many optimization quandaries. Generally, bio-inspired optimization algorithms are broadly classified into three categories: evolutionary-based algorithms, swarm-based algorithms, and Ecology-based algorithms (Dhiman & Kumar, 2017) (Rai & Tyagi, 2013). Evolutionary-based algorithms (EA) are stochastic search methods that simulate the natural biological evolution and the social behavior of living species such as reproduction selection, recombination, and mutation. Evolutionary-based algorithms have been developed to find the optimal or near-optimum solutions to large-scale optimization quandaries, for which traditional mathematical techniques may fail. One of the most renowned Evolutionary-based algorithms in the computer science field is the Genetic Algorithm (GA) (Holland, J. H. 1975). Swarm intelligence (SI) concerns the designing and developing of intelligent interactive multi-agent systems that cooperate to gather to achieve a specific goal that cannot be achieved by a single-agent (Almufti, 2017). Swarm intelligence is defined by Dorigo M as \"The emergent collective intelligence of groups of simple agents\" (Li, Y., 2010). Swarm-based algorithms are inspired by behaviors of some social living beings in nature, such as ants, birds, bats, bees, termites, and fishes (Almufti, 2017). One of the most renowned Swarm intelligence algorithms in the computer science field is the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) (Renas & Abdulnabi 2018). Ecological-inspired algorithm (ECO) is an assessment to develop cooperative search algorithms, it depends on populations of individuals, and each population develops according to a search strategy. In a way, that the individuals of each population are modified according to the mechanisms of diversification, intensification, and the initial parameters of the search strategy (Begon & Harper, 2006). The ecological inspiration stems from the use of some ecological concepts, such as habitats, ecological relationships, and ecological successions (May & McLean, 2007). One of the most renowned ecological inspired algorithms in the computer science field is the Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO). This paper presents an overview study of bio-inspired optimization algorithms such as (Ant Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, Biogeography-Based Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm, Elephant Herding Optimization, \u2026 etc.) according to its different classification (evolutionary-based, swarm-based, and Ecology-based) and the biological field that they are inspired from and the areas where these algorithms have been successfully applied."}, {"heading": "Bio-Inspired Algorithms (Bias) Taxonomy", "text": "Verily, optimization problems in the world of reality are oftentimes exceedingly arduous to unravel and do involve the optimization of multiple objectives. The majority of these optimization problems are, in truth, NP-hard problems, which cannot be resolved through the use of traditional deterministic algorithms (Rai & Tyagi, 2013). Bio-Inspired algorithms have been proven to be excellent methods for addressing these intricate optimization problems and have been employed to solve many such problems that belong to various domains. Over the course of several decades, diverse Bio-Inspired Algorithms have been developed, drawing inspiration from different biological swarms that occur in nature (Binitha, et al, 2012). Figure (1) doth present a graphical classification of some of the well-known Bio-Inspired Algorithms (Dubey, Panigrahi & Pandit, 2014). Table (1) doth show the meaning of the Abbreviations of the bio-inspired algorithms that are used in the figure (1). The performance of many global optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms (GA), doth depend mainly on the evolutionary settings of these algorithms. For example, by changing the values of mutation and crossover, GA may lead to different optimization results and convergence speed. Generally, the requirements for an effective Optimization algorithm (Bio-Inspired, Natural Inspired, Conventional, Non-Conventional) doth involve (Storn & Price, 1997): a) Minimizing time, cost, and effort for solving complex optimization problems. b) Ability to handle non-differentiable, nonlinear and multimodal cost functions. c) Parallelizability to cope with computation-intensive cost functions. d) Good convergence properties, i.e. consistent convergence to the global minimum in consecutive independent trials. e) Ease of use, i.e. few control variables to steer the minimization. These variables should also be robust and easy to choose."}, {"heading": "Evolutionary Algorithms (Ea)", "text": "Verily, Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are the most renowned, traditional and established algorithms amidst the nature-inspired algorithms, inspired from the biological evolution in nature. In the bygone year, EA hath been extensively employed for solving sundry specializations of science and real-time applications to find an optimum solution for complex and optimization problems (Das & Suganthan, 2011). The word Evolutionary algorithm is used to define a collection of optimization techniques that simulate the natural biological evolution and the social behavior of living species. Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary strategy (ES), Genetic algorithm (GA), Genetic programming (GP), and Granular Agent Evolutionary Algorithm are the most well-known Algorithms that belong to Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) (Holland, J. H. 1975)."}, {"heading": "Genetic Algorithm (Ga)", "text": "In the realm of artificial intelligence, the genetic algorithm (GA) is a computation algorithm of the evolutionary sort, employed to generate efficacious solutions to problems of optimization and search. Genetic algorithms are a subset of evolutionary algorithms (EA), which generate solutions to optimization problems through techniques inspired by natural evolution, such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover (DeJong, K. 1975). GA is inspired by the principles of genetics and evolution, and emulates the reproductive behavior observed in biological populations; it belongs to stochastically search algorithm bases on principles of natural selection and recombination (Holland, J. H. 1975).\n\nGA engenders a populace of initial individuals called chromosomes, where each chromosome denotes a solution to the problem to be solved. Each chromosome is composed of a set of genes, and by applying recombination to these structures, such as crossover and mutation, they endeavor to find an optimal solution for a given problem (Thengade & Dondal, 2012). Genetic algorithms have been successfully applied to solve problems related to various fields such as NP-Hard Problems, mathematics, computational science, phylogenetics, bioinformatics, engineering, economics, chemistry, manufacturing, physics, pharmacometrics, and other fields (Goldberg, 1989).

The behavior of living swarms, such as birds, fish, and ants, is used as a model for these systems (Almufti, 2017). SI is a constituent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and was first introduced by Jing Wang and Gerardo Beni in 1989, as a collection of algorithms for controlling robotic swarms within the framework of global optimization (Beni & Wang, 1989)."}, {"heading": "Ant Colony Optimization Aco", "text": "Verily, the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm is a heuristic algorithm that doth employ the behavior of real ants in discovering the shortest path betwixt their current location and a source of sustenance (Almufti, 2017) (Almufti & Shaban, 2018). Indeed, ants are a sagacious species that doth dwell and labor together in swarms (colonies), and these ants doth communicate with each other indirectly by means of an odorous chemical substance that they can deposit and smell, which is called pheromone trails (Dorigo & Maniezzo, 1996) (Almufti & Shaban, 2018). Within a swarm, each ant, which doth represent an agent of the swarm, doth randomly lay down a pheromone trail as it doth make its way to a source of sustenance. If any ant doth find a source of sustenance, it doth return to the nest by following the pheromone trail. In the event that the pheromone level doth increase in any given path, all the other agents doth follow that path (Renas & Abdulnabi, 2018).

PSO doth simulate this social behavior as a tool for optimization to solve some optimization problems and NP-Hard problems such as the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) (Almufti, 2015) (Almufti & Shaban, 2018).

The Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) Algorithm is a global optimization algorithm fashioned and inspired from the mathematical models of biogeography (Simon, 2008). This algorithm, based on populations, doth employ the notion of the migration strategy of animals or other species to solve optimization problems. BBO, like unto other optimization algorithms (GA, ACO, PSO, and so forth), is a population-based algorithm wherein a population of candidate solutions is utilized to solve a global optimization problem. In BBO, the initial population is not disregarded among different generations. Instead, the migration concept is employed to modify the population (Rahmati & Zandieh, 2011). As another distinction, in every generation, the fitness function is not used directly to modify the population; BBO used fitness to determine the immigration and emigration rates. Applications that use these ideas allow information sharing between candidate solutions (Simon, 2008).\n\nIn BBO, each habitat is considered as an individual and hath its habitat suitability index (HSI) instead of fitness value to show the efficiency of individual (Alroomi, Albasri & Talaq, 2013). A high-HSI habitat denotes a good solution, and a low-HSI habitat denotes a poor solution. Solution features emigrate from high-HSI habitats, which is called emigrating habitat, to low-HSI habitats, which is called immigrating habitat (Rahmati & Zandieh, 2011).
