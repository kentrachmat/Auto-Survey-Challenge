These algorithms are used to solve complex optimization problems and have gained popularity due to their diverse, robust, dynamic, and complex nature. This paper provides an overview of the taxonomy of bio-inspired optimization algorithms based on the biological field that inspired them and the areas where they have been successfully applied."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The paper discusses the increasing complexity of real-life problems and the need for useful methods to find and optimize solutions for complex and optimization problems. Bio-inspired algorithms (BIA) have shown significant proficiency in solving many optimization problems and are broadly classified into three categories: evolutionary-based algorithms, swarm-based algorithms, and ecology-based algorithms. Evolutionary-based algorithms simulate natural biological evolution and social behavior to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to large-scale optimization problems. Swarm intelligence is concerned with designing and developing intelligent interactive multi-agent systems that cooperate to achieve a specific goal. Swarm-based algorithms are inspired by behaviors of social living beings in nature. Ecological-inspired algorithms depend on populations of individuals and each population develops according to a search strategy. The paper provides an overview of bio-inspired optimization algorithms and their classifications, biological inspirations, and successful applications."}, {"heading": "Bio-Inspired Algorithms (Bias) Taxonomy", "text": "Real-world optimization problems are often complex and involve multi-objective optimization. Traditional deterministic algorithms cannot solve most of these problems, which are NP-hard. Bio-Inspired algorithms have been proven to be effective in addressing these complex optimization problems and have been applied to solve problems in various domains. Over the past few decades, various Bio-Inspired Algorithms have been developed, taking inspiration from different biological swarms that occur in nature. The performance of many global optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms, depends mainly on the evolutionary settings of these algorithms. Effective optimization algorithms should minimize time, cost, and effort for solving complex optimization problems, handle non-differentiable, nonlinear and multimodal cost functions, be parallelizable to cope with computation-intensive cost functions, have good convergence properties, and be easy to use with few control variables that are robust and easy to choose. Figure (1) presents a graphical classification of some well-known Bio-Inspired Algorithms, and Table (1) shows the meaning of the abbreviations used in the figure."}, {"heading": "Evolutionary Algorithms (Ea)", "text": "The paper discusses Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), which are a type of nature-inspired algorithm that simulate biological evolution and social behavior of living species.

It is part of a larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA) that use techniques inspired by natural evolution, such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover. GA mimics the reproduction behavior observed in biological populations and develops a population of initial individuals called chromosomes, where each chromosome denotes a solution to the problem to be solved. By applying recombination techniques such as crossover and mutation, GA attempts to find an optimal solution for a given problem. GA has been successfully applied to solve problems in various fields such as mathematics, computational science, bioinformatics, engineering, economics, and more. Figure (2) illustrates the procedure of how GA works."}, {"heading": "Evolutionary Strategy Es", "text": "Evolution Strategy (ES) is a computer science optimization technique based on evolution and adaptation.

Ants communicate with each other indirectly through pheromone trails, which they deposit and smell. In a swarm, each ant randomly lays down a pheromone trail on its way to a food source. If an ant finds a source of food, it returns to the nest by following the pheromone trail. If the pheromone level increases on a particular path, all the other ants follow that path. The ACO algorithm works by simulating this behavior of ants. The algorithm is useful in solving optimization problems, and it has been applied in various fields such as transportation, telecommunications, and manufacturing."}, {"heading": "Particle Swarm Optimization Pso", "text": "The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is based on the social behavior of organisms such as fishing, bird flocking, and schooling.

Male calves leave their clan when they reach adulthood. The EHO algorithm is modeled after this behavior and is used to find optimal solutions to problems.

BBO is a population-based algorithm that uses the idea of immigration and emigration of species between habitats to solve optimization problems. In BBO, each habitat is considered as an individual and has its habitat suitability index (HSI) to show the efficiency of the individual. High-HSI habitats denote good solutions, and low-HSI habitats denote poor solutions. Solution features emigrate from high-HSI habitats to low-HSI habitats.
